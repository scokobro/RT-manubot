Story of radio towers in confined largely to the decade between 1932 and 1942. The origins of the radio towers go back somewhat earlier, and the effective end of the radio tower is more or less lost in the fog of war.

Known documentation is scarce and highly fragmented.

*Kōshū-yō rajio chōshu shisetsu*, mentioned on p106 of the 1932 Radio Yearbook, following on from a section describing the uptake and previous years events in 'rajio taisō'.

In general, based on the evidence of the remaining examples, radio towers can very roughly be divided into two general types design-wise; traditional and modern. The traditional type can often be very similar to a the (kaku-bozen-gata)[^toro] *tōrō* lanterns commonly seen around temple grounds and graveyards. Radio towers often share the square ground plan and the same five-fold structure (see @fig:toro)

The 'modern' type is rather more diverse design-wise but often echoes the Art Deco modernistic trends of the 1930s. There are also some radio towers that do not fit neatly into either of these categories, but they are relatively few. It seems as though the traditional type has survived better than the modern, @ichima17[61] suggests this may be because of their resemblance to the *tōrō* lanterns found around temples, and perhaps the assumption that they have some kind of religious association and are thus best treated with respect or at least left alone.
