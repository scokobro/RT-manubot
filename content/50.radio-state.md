# Radio and the Nation

<!-- Role of NHK outside producing and broadcasting programming; encouraging take-up of radio listening, certifying and categorizing receivers, training technicians (pro. and am.) -->

This section looks at two important and characteristic aspects of the radio-state relationship in interwar Japan, the commemorative events arranged around the 'year 2600' celebrations in 1940 and, in the decade or so leading up to this high point of Japanese national feeling, the role of sport and sports broadcasting. As far as the focus of this paper, the radio tower, is concerned, the latter is particularly important.

Unlike the other media mentioned here citizen's participation in consumption requires more than just the few 'sen' to enter a cinema or purchase a magazine. The acquisition of a radio receiver was a major decision as receivers were far from cheap, likewise they required regular maintenance and attention.

## Wave of popular participation

Rhetoric of the 'ichi-oku' - identified the Japanese with this term emphasising the massive scale of the population, and their lack of differentiation, merely referred to as 'the one-hundred million'. Unfortunately for this snappy phrase to make sense the population of the home islands was insufficient, being around 70 million, but luckily [after DATE?] the citizens of the newly acquired occupied territories could be included and reality could be made to coincide with rhetoric in a more convincing way.

Important to know that this idea only made sense if the populations of occupied areas and colonies were included.

### Events of 1940: Kigen 2600 { #sec:kigen26 }

The later half of the 1930s saw little increase in the number of  radio towers put in place. The rapid increase after 1938 is in part due to the perceived significance of mass participation in the events planned by the  state to mark the (largely mythical) 2600th year since the founding of the Imperial line, thus Japan itself. The year marked as 1940 in the western calendar was, in the _kigen_ calendar, which took the year of the mythical enthronement of Japan's first emperor, Jimmu, 660BCE, as its start and had been used somewhat inconsistently in certain official documents since the early Meiji period, the year 2600. Seniority is important in Japanes society and this was an opportunity to mark Japan's international status as a senior nation; whereas the western powers were merely in their 1940th year, Japan (ran the subtext) had already existed for a good six centuries longer.

It was well understood that radio was now an important tool of mass mobilisation the desire to have truly national and unified mass participation in the variety of events planned for 1940 meant that radio was bound to have a role.

What was the penetration rate in 1939? TODO

However there was also a feeling that Japan had as yet failed to capitalise and make best use of radio broadcasting and that increased efforts to promote radio were urgently necessary.

By comparison with other radio nations at the end of 1938 take-up in Japan was still relatively low; in many European countries radios were already in 10-20 per cent of homes, the US had already already passed the 20 per cent mark while to the same time the rate in Japan was still under 5 per cent @nhknenkan40[6]. It was felt that more had to be done to bring radio to as great a proportion of the populace as possible.

A 1939 article entitled 'Broadcasting and the State' penned by Miyamoto Yoshio, a senior bureaucrat in the Ministry of Communications, elucidates contemporary thinking on the relationship of broadcasting, at that point NHK, government and the Japanese people; since its inception in 1926 broadcasting in Japan, he explains, has undertaken as its mission the improvement of Japanese culture and the 'building of national spirit', and it has undertaken this role as a 'representative agency of the state' [@miyamo39 12]. In the article he laments that Japan was perhaps late in realising the power of broadcasting and stresses the urgency of realising the goal of 'one household, one receiver' (*ikko ichi jushinki*).[^campaign] In retrospect, the scheme to set up radio towers in public places around Japan can be seen as a way to provide a temporary answer to this concern, providing public access to radio broadcasts without burdening individual households with the costs of purchasing and maintaining a receiving set.

[^campaign]: NHK's three-month campaign to encourage households to each buy a radio took place starting in December 1938 [@akiyam18,141]

@Fig:hagi shows one radio tower specifically linked to the commemorative events of _kigen_ 2600; the plaque on the rear face (pictured right) lists the names of the towers's 'sewanin' (organisers) and gives the date of its construction as _kigen_ 2601, that is, 1941. This tower's design is somewhat unusual in that it has a well-defined  front and back and seems to 'point' in a certain direction. The front face still bears the worn letters JOOK, the call sign of the NHK Kyoto broadcast station, and lower down another plaque which is now unfortunately too dilapidated to be read.

By 1942 concerns around the use of radio for national purposes had reached a --- perhaps somewhat hysterical --- point where it was seen as a matter of national survival; the authors of the _1942 Radio Yearbook_ write that the fall of France in the summer of 1940 was due to its failure both to prepare its airforce and _to make sure its radio broadcasts were used for the good of the state_ @nhknenkan42[4]. Given Japan's concerns during this period about the 'ABCD encirclement' and its own national survival, it is understandable that it would be eager to learn from the perceived mistakes of countries which seemed to have failed to have survived.
