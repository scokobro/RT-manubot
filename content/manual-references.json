    "abstract": "How do journalists working for different state-funded international news organizations legitimize their relationship to the governments which support them? In what circumstances might such journalists resist the diplomatic strategies of their funding states? We address these questions through a comparative study of journalists working for international news organizations funded by the Chinese, US, UK and Qatari governments. Using 52 interviews with journalists covering humanitarian issues, we explain how they minimized tensions between their diplomatic role and dominant norms of journalistic autonomy by drawing on three – broadly shared – legitimizing narratives, involving different kinds of boundary-work. In the first ‘exclusionary’ narrative, journalists differentiated their ‘truthful’ news reporting from the ‘false’ state ‘propaganda’ of a common Other, the Russian-funded network, RT. In the second ‘fuzzifying’ narrative, journalists deployed the ambiguous notion of ‘soft power’ as an ambivalent ‘boundary concept’, to defuse conflicts between journalistic and diplomatic agendas. In the final ‘inversion’ narrative, journalists argued that, paradoxically, their dependence on funding states gave them greater ‘operational autonomy’. Even when journalists did resist their funding states, this was hidden or partial, and prompted less by journalists’ concerns about the political effects of their work, than by serious threats to their personal cultural capital.",

    "abstract": "Although coherence has been widely studied in computer-mediated communication (CMC), insufficient attention has been paid to emergent multimodal forms. This study analyzes a popular commentary system on Chinese and Japanese video-sharing sites – known as danmu or danmaku – where anonymous comments are superimposed on and scroll across the video frame. Through content and multimodal discourse analysis, we unpack danmu-mediated communication analyzing the newest interface (on Bilibili.com), the comments, the interpersonal interactions and the unusual use of the second-person pronoun. Results show that despite the technological constraints (hidden authorship, unmarked sending date and lack of options to structure comments), users construct order in interactions through repetition, danmu-specific expressions and multimodal references, while using playful language to make fun. This study provides an up-to-date analysis on an increasingly popular CMC medium beyond well-studied social networking sites, and broadens the understanding of coherence in contemporary CMC.",

    "abstract": "As one of the most popular online media in China, personal livestreaming attracts massive attention and effects on human social communication in multiple novel ways. This article explores the semiotic mechanism of the barrage, a special form of commenting, on China’s livestreaming platforms. Drawing on cultural semiotic theories, it discusses the impact of the barrage by the fandom of China’s livestreaming. Two interrelated semiotic paradoxes are created by two interrelated forms of markedness from the use of the barrage by Chinese livestreaming fans, that is, the markedness of time and the markedness of space. Through careful assessment of the use of the barrage in China’s livestreaming fandom, this article sheds new light on China’s livestreaming and its potential impact on the future of digital China.",

    "abstract": "Since the publication of Peng and Nisbett’s seminal paper on dialectical thinking, a substantial amount of empirical research has replicated and expanded on the core finding that people differ in the degree to which they view the world as inherently contradictory and in constant flux. Dialectical thinkers (who are more often members of East Asian than Western cultures) show greater expectation of change in tasks related to explanation and prediction and greater tolerance of contradiction in tasks involving the reconciliation of contradictory information. The authors show how these effects are manifested in the domains of the self, emotional experience, psychological well-being, attitudes and evaluations, social categorization and perception, and judgment and decision making. They note important topics in need of further investigation and offer predictions concerning possible cultural differences in unexplored domains as a function of the presence or absence of naïve dialecticism.",

The relationship between press freedom, foreign direct investment, and economic growth is analyzed using a balanced panel of 115 countries. The existence of a bidirectional relationship between press freedom and economic growth is established using the generalized method of moments technique. We also find a bidirectional relationship between foreign direct investment and economic growth using the analysis. Our results are not contradicted by similar indices produced by Reporters Sans Frontières and Freedom House. \\[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR\\]",

    "abstract": "Recent communication research concerning participatory politics has found that the effects of media, especially campaign ads, conventional news, and online political resources, are largely mediated through interpersonal discussion about politics. This article extends this line of theorizing about the role of political conversation in citizen competence by testing an O-S-R-O-R model of campaign communication mediation, a modification and extension of the longstanding O-S-O-R model of communication effects. This model combines insights from iterations of the communication mediation model (McLeod et al., 2001; Shah et al., 2007) and cognitive mediation model (Eveland, 2001; Eveland, Shah,\\\n&amp; Kwak, 2003) to theorize a set of the interrelated reasoning (R) processes that channel the influences of campaign exposure and news consumption on political engagement. Three key mediators of campaign and news influence are postulated: face-to-face political conversation, online political messaging, and cognitive reflection. We provide empirical evidence to test this model by merging two datasets: (1) tracking of the content and placement of campaign messages in the 2000 and 2004 election cycles, and (2) surveys of traditional and digital media consumption and levels of campaign participation during these same elections. Findings reveal that political conversation, political messaging, and cognitive reflection mediate the effects of campaign advertising exposure and news consumption on political participation and knowledge, providing considerable support for our theory. This O-S-R-O-R model helps organize a large body of theorizing and research on campaigns and conversation in the communication sciences.",

    "annote": "AbstractThis paper examines the 2016 US presidential election campaign to identify problems with, causes of and solutions to the contemporary fake news phenomenon. To achieve this, we employ textual analysis and feedback from engagement, meetings and panels with technologists, journalists, editors, non-profits, public relations firms, analytics firms and academics during the globally leading technology conference, South-by-South West, in March 2017. We further argue that what is most significant about the contemporary fake news furore is what it portends: the use of personally and emotionally targeted news produced by algo-journalism and what we term “empathic media”empathic media. In assessing solutions to this democratically problematic situation, we recommend that greater attention is paid to the role of digital advertising in causing, and combating, both the contemporary fake news phenomenon, and the near-horizon variant of empathically optimised automated fake news.KEYWORDS: digital advertising, emotion, empathic media, Facebook, fake news, Trump election",

    "abstract": "New technologies are deeply transforming the broadcasting industry. What we have seen so far is only the beginning of a long story. Inevitably, industry regulations must adapt, which means that a wide-ranging rethink of current practices is required. In order to assess the likely evolution of the industry, this article decomposes it into a number of components, from conception of programmes to their broadcasting, including distribution, storage and licensing. Contrary to popular expectations, the analysis suggests that the current high degree of concentration will, if anything, increase. The policy implication is that regulation, so far driven by now obsolete technological constraints, should increasingly emphasize promoting competition.

    "abstract": "Concentrations of several trace elements were determined in mosses, higher plants and organs of small mammals from a geothermal area in Tuscany (central Italy). Increased deposition of Hg, As, B, and Sb was detected in biological samples collected within a few hundred meters of geothermal power plants. Among the species considered, the moss Hypnum cupressiforme was the most efficient accumulator of trace elements. Contamination levels in a fodder-plant (Hedysarum coronarium) and vegetables grown in the geothermal field did not seem to pose health risks for consumers. However, a statistically significant increase in Hg, B, and As concentrations was found in the kidney and muscle of small mammals living close to geothermal installations. Biological effects of B pollution were detected in two sensitive plant species.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores Korean color terms as a semantic field and discusses their related phenomena. Taking issue with Berlin and Kay’s (1969) contention that Korean color terms are at Stage VII (composed of eleven color terms: hayahta, kkamahta, ppalkahta, phalahta, nolahta, chengsayk, kalsayk, casayk, punhongsayk, tungsayk, hoysayk), this paper instead argues that they are at Stage IV (composed of only five color terms: hayahta, kkamahta, ppalkahta, phalahta, nolahta). To support this claim, three pieces of evidence are discussed: (1) the inflected nature of the indigenous Korean words, (2) the presence of the five Chinese loans (replacing the native ones), and (3) the grue phenomenon. In addition, this paper addresses two kinds of phonetic symbolism, bearing crucially on reconstructed basic Korean color words (i.e., vowel and consonant alternation). Finally, this paper casts doubt on the viability of positive correlations between color vocabulary size and culture complexity proposed by Berlin and Kay, showing that the expandability of basic Korean color terms heavily rests on the application of certain morphological rules.",

Many of these conceptions are imposed and absorbed passively from outside, or from the past, and are accepted and lived uncritically. In this case they constitute what Gramsci calls ’common sense’ (or, in another context, ’folklore’). Many elements in popular common sense contribute to people’s subordination by making situations of inequality and oppression appear to them as natural and unchangeable. Nevertheless, common sense must not be thought of as ’false consciousness’ or as ideology in a merely negative sense. It is contradictory it contains elements of truth as well as elements of misrepresentation and it is upon these contradictions that leverage may be obtained in a ’struggle of political ’hegemonies’ ’. For Gramsci it was important that Marxism should not present itself as an abstract philosophy but should enter people’s common sense, giving them a more critical understanding of their own situation. See in particular Section XI and ’philosophy of praxis’ in this glossary).",

    "abstract": "AbstractJournalism is immersed in a context of significant changes. Technological innovations, the Internet and digitisation combined with a double-industry structure and a contextual crisis are the basis of this complex situation that has generated a strong decrease in revenues. This paper analyses one basic element of the redefinition of the journalism sector: the emergence of new business models in a digital convergence scenario. A case study methodology is used to analyse the strategy developed by the key Spanish newspaper editorial groups Prisa, Unidad Editorial SA (Unedisa) and Vocento. By utilising this approach, we are able to analyse the position of these editorial groups as they attempt to define the current sector and to face changes in the digital era.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThis study focuses on the discourse around social morals relating to the family that appear in written material and videos produced by conservative intellectuals belonging to the Nippon Kaigi (The Japanese Nationalist Association), which further their agenda of surveillance and control over the Japanese population. In particular, we focus on discourse on the contentious issue of fūfubessei (the retention of former family names after marriage). Here we aim to understand (1) the reasoning of their core argument that adopting fūfubessei will lead to the collapse of family, society and the Japanese nation, (2) the ideology behind this argument, and (3) the rhetoric used in attempts to persuade the public. We posit that the hostility towards fūfubessei is a reflection of the broader agenda of conservatism which leverages a moral imperative to protect traditional and normative notions of family and, ultimately, what it means to be Japanese.",

    "abstract": "Kurosawa’s Rashōmon (Rashomon, 1950) and its success at the 1951 Venice Film Festival is often regarded as the pivotal point for Japanese film export as well as the point of departure for Japanese film’s full-blown, successful exposure to overseas markets and audiences. Awards subsequently won by other films directed by Japanese nationals corroborate this interpretation, which, however, tends to marginalise earlier attempts to realise the ‘dream of export’. At best, these are regarded as isolated, eccentric events; yet, the interpretation of these films as predictable failures is to a large part influenced by hindsight. This article takes a film historical approach to discuss the Japanese industry’s early push onto the German market, revolving around three German–Japanese ‘co-productions’ that display varying degrees of international cooperation among equals (1926, 1932 and 1933). These endeavours were embedded within increasing industrial efforts to push international exports and were both a reaction to ‘inauthentic’ Western representational practices and a means to assert a cultural power position through industrial success. Early transnational currents in Japanese cinema pose various questions related to the notion of a ‘national cinema’, and the issue of film as art, as propaganda vehicle or/and as profit-making product. Although being confined within restrictive frameworks of representational traditions of imagining Others, these films demonstrate a two-way flow, as protagonists in both countries considered film as an agent for change in the intertwined spheres of the industrial, national and cultural.",

    "abstract": "Despite the de jure equality achieved in the second half of the 20th century, racial discrimination and racist political movements persist. This has encouraged the orthodoxy that a ‘new racism’ serves as an ideological basis of contemporary white investment in racial inequality in Western Europe, North America and Australasia. It is argued that this ‘new racism’ is shown in more subtle and indirect formal expressions, such as a denial of societal discrimination, rather than the once popular expressions of ‘old‐fashioned’ genetic inferiority and segregationism. In opposition to this conceptualization, I review quantitative and qualitative studies from social psychology, sociology and political science, as well as historical analyses, to show that the ‘old‐fashioned’ formal expression of racism was not especially popular before de jure racial equality and is not especially unpopular now. I also show that there is nothing new about formal expressions that criticize cultural difference or deny societal discrimination. Thus, there is greater historical continuity in racism than the notion of a ‘new racism’ allows. This suggests that the first task of a critical social psychology of racism is a proper conceptualization of racism itself.",

    "abstract": "Films as a cultural medium both reflect dominant attitudes in society and also play a pivotal role in the shaping of our perceptions and ideas. Within popular culture, crime has long been a popular theme, particularly for contemporary film-makers. While a substantial and growing body of research exists on the portrayal of crimes and criminals in the literature, few efforts have been made to conduct a systematic analytical study of the construction of justice in film. As such, the general purpose of this article was to identify pervasive themes inherent in the portrayals of crime and justice across a wide spectrum of films. We examined the connections drawn between the narratives of justice that emerge in some films and the manners in which crime and criminality are constructed. Our analysis draws upon the social constructionist literature in deciphering the meanings and messages which are conveyed through films on the themes of justice.",

    "abstract": "This article seeks to examine the rapid rise of labor market dualism and inequality in Japan and Korea. It argues that the path-dependent trajectories of labor market and social protection reforms biased in favor of labor market insiders explain recent institutional developments in the two countries. In Japan, political coalitions between conservative policymakers, large firms, and core regular workers in reform politics consolidated labor market dualism and inequality during its protracted recession. Meanwhile, the organizational capacity of large chaebol unions deepened the inequality and the segmentation of the dualistic labor market in Korea. By examining three key institutional domains of the labor market—labor market reform, wage bargaining, and social protection—this article analyzes the ways in which Japan and Korea have reinforced dualism and inequality over the past two decades.",

    "abstract": "Private news media across the world are trying to develop pay models for news. Our understanding of what drives behaviour and attitudes to paying for online news, however, remains limited. We use survey data from six countries (France, Germany, Japan, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States) to investigate three hypotheses: (1) those who use public service media for online news are less likely to pay for/express a willingness to pay because they have a reference price of zero for online news, (2) those who pay for print newspapers are more likely to pay for/express a willingness to pay for online news because they have a reference price above zero for offline news, and (3) that younger people are more likely to pay for/express a willingness to pay for online news because they are more likely to have a reference price above zero for other digital content. Our analysis supports Hypotheses 2 and 3, but not Hypothesis 1. Therefore, paying for offline news increases the likelihood of paying for online news because it helps create a reference price above zero. However, consuming free online news from public service media does not by itself create a reference price of zero for online news.",

    "abstract": "The traditional model of journalism in western societies, dominated by legacy media outlets such as newspapers and television, has undergone fundamental change in the twenty-first century. One consequence has been significant job losses within these newsrooms. As journalists negotiate new employment post-job loss in Australia, this paper asks, how has this impacted on their professional identity? Drawing on varying conceptualisations of professional identity as a set of values and as a set of work practices, this paper presents data from a survey of 225 journalists who had been laid off between 2012 and 2014 in Australia, to explore whether and how journalists’ professional identity changed after redundancy. The results indicated that professional identity was likely to fade post-job loss, which indicates that identity may be more closely linked to a journalism work context. In addition, the paper found that the loss of institutional legitimacy may also be affecting the respondents’ current journalism practice. Conversely, not all participants who noted their identity was intact still worked as journalists or in journalism. This research has implications for the changing media workforce, as it indicates that notions of journalistic professional identity are still contested and complicated.",

    "annote": "THE INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY OF JOURNALISM IN WHICH PEOPLE TAKE PART -’OhmyNews,’ the Democratization of the Republic of Korea, and the Dismantling of Kisha Clubs-’OhmyNews’ is an independent Internet newspaper in the Republic of Korea, and as such it wields great influence now. It is reportedly the largest Internet newspaper in the world. Five years ago, OhmyNews was published by four professional reporters and 727 ’citizen reporters. ’The number of OhmyNews citizen reporters has grown to more than 35,000 today. Mr. Oh Yeon-Ho, founder and chief representative of OhmyNews, gave a lecture at Doshisha University on 15 September 2004. We could hold a subject of inquiry on alternative media from Mr. Oh’s lecture and could interview him. We found that, in fact, the success of OhmyNews is a remarkable accident in the world of journalism. So much so that many big media outlets in the world, such as the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN and BBC have covered Mr. Oh’s experimental challenge and his success with OhmyNews. We consider one of the big achievements of OhmyNews to be the abolition of the closed system of press clubs in Korea known (in Japanese) as Kisha Clubs. We thus refer to Internet newspapers in the Republic of Korea (especially OhmyNews) and Kisha Clubs in this article. As to why ’OhmyNews’ succeeded, we can point to several reasons. The most important reason, however, is the existence of the ’prepared citizen’ in the Republic of Korea. In the Republic of Korea, through a long fight for democratization, people have come to not believe in the traditional corporate media. The corporate media is identified in the public mind as standing by the ’powers that be’ and not reporting the truth. Consequently, people in Korea have held high expectations for the appearance of alternative news media. Many people harbor a strong will to change their society, and they can do so by supporting OhmyNews and participating in it as ’citizen reporters.’ OhmyNews operates on the basis of several important concepts, the most important being : ’Every citizen is a reporter.’ Mr. Oh explained that ’This concept is the most characteristic’ of OhmyNews. The traditional corporate media represents journalism of the 20th century. It is a one-way stream in which professional reporters write articles and the reader only reads it. But OhmyNews is breaking that cycle of 20th century journalism. OhmyNews has made journalism a two-way stream in which the reporter is reader, and the reader is reporter. The system of Kisha Clubs is a unique system in Japan and the Republic of Korea. It is an exclusive and conservative system which excludes non-member reporters. Mr. Oh of OhmyNews had successfully sued for abolition of the Kisha Clubs in Korea, and following that, President Roh Moo-Hyon abolished the Kisha Clubs of the country’s central administrative offices. This dismantling of Kisha Clubs is rapidly advancing in the Republic of Korea. Yet in Japan it is not advancing at all, rightly inviting criticism of Japan’s press system. But that does not appear to faze Japanese reporters of the corporate media and some Japanese scholars, who insist that Kisha Clubs are the most proper system for Japan. By contrast, abolishing the Kisha Clubs in Korea is the result of strenuous efforts by alternative media such as OhmyNews and a large number of supporters. All of which begs the questions : What benefits do we receive from the Japanese press club system? And what needs to be done to eliminate this outdated, injurious system? We dare to envision the kind of journalism in which people take part -as with OhmyNews- and at the same time, we aim to solve the many problems of journalism in Japan, above all permanently dissolving the Kisha Club system.",

    "abstract": "This paper argues for the relevance of the media history of the press. Using a broad and open media concept, this perspective should be understood as the study of the construction and communication of the self-images and ideology of the press. Rather than describing the complex of problems as images that are ‘spread’ through one channel (newspapers) by one actor (the press), it should be seen as a mutual exchange between various media and various actors. Different audiences have been resources for the press, just as the press has been a resource for them. Instead of separating proper journalism, the spreading of the self-image, and the reception of different audiences as clearly defined areas, they must be seen as constituting each other. Focusing on the funeral of Swedish editor Lars Hierta, the paper argues for the methodological advantages inherent in the media event and the surrounding cultural circumstances.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTGunkanjima Island (Battleship Island) is an abandoned coalmine and community off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. At its peak, the island was fuelling the industrialisation of modern Japan, home to a community of over 5000 residents with one of the highest population densities in the world and the site of early modern concrete high-rise buildings. With the shift to oil, the island soon became abandoned going into decay. A recent rise in media attention and the inclusion as a 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Site has generated interest in industrial heritage tourism on the island. This paper explores the rise and fall of the island as a coalmine and the transition to an industrial heritage tourism site. A framework is presented illustrating the transformation of industrial sites into industrial heritage tourist attractions.",

    "abstract": "This study presents selected findings related to journalistic competencies or skills from surveys of more than 29,000 journalists working in 31 countries or territories, conducted between 1996 and 2011. The data come from survey studies included in Weaver and Willnat’s 2012 book, The Global Journalist in the 21st Century. The study focuses on aspects such as journalists’ age and education, working conditions, professional values or orientations, opinions about the importance of different aspects of the job, and attitudes toward new reporting skills that are necessary to cope with a multimedia news environment. The study concludes that there are no clear patterns of such competency among the journalists included in this analysis. However, tendencies were observed for some countries to have younger, less experienced, less formally educated journalists who do not highly value the interpretive or analytical role of journalism, who are less satisfied with their work, who have less freedom in their work, and who lack the multimedia skills necessary in the age of online journalism. The study also calls for systematic content analysis studies that investigate whether self-reported competencies of journalists in each nation actually correlate with the quality of the news products they create.",

    "abstract": "In the aftermath of earthquakes, tsunamis, such as the 2011 Great East Japan Tsunami, caused enormous damage around the world. With the extreme disaster events of the past, nations improved disaster preparedness and response through sensors and tsunami early warning systems. Even with system usage, however, governments still need to warn the targeted citizens &ndash; who may be anywhere within the vulnerable areas &ndash; of predicted tsunami and ordered mass evacuations within a very limited lead time. While social media research is on the rise outside the domain of social networking, very little is written about Twitter use for tsunami early warning. In this research, therefore, we examined the utility of Twitter as a tsunami early warning network, which engages citizens and disaster management agencies in diffusing disaster information. We conducted a social network analysis of Twitter information flows among the central disaster warning agency&rsquo;s Twitter followers during the 2012 Indonesia Earthquake.\\<br /\\>",

Among some psychological factors, only importance was related to intended transmission of rumor. Surprisingly, accuracy and anxiety were not predictors of any transmission. Estimated transmission of criticisms was higher when its importance was high, while that of rumor did not vary according to importance. Interestingly, although participants estimated that criticisms were spread more than rumor, they intended to transmit rumors as much as criticisms.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing theory states that either Japanese voters have stopped ideologically distinguishing parties or that the main political parties in Japan have become more centrist in recent years. These arguments are based on survey questions asking citizens to locate parties on an ideological scale. However, these questions may suffer from noise caused by respondents who misinterpret the question wording or answer the questions inappropriately to mask their misunderstanding of the terms “left” and “right”. To address this problem by extracting only the views of those who know the meaning of left–right terms, this article develops a mixture model. Applying the model to an opinion poll conducted after the 2012 Japanese general election, I confirm that those who comprehend the left–right terminology – slightly over half of all voters – largely perceived parties’ ideologies in the same way as experts. Additionally, I find that even these voters face difficulties in placing ambiguous or new parties on the political spectrum. This study has implications not only for understanding trends in Japanese political ideology, but also for survey design and analysis of heterogeneous survey responses.",

    "abstract": "The paper takes the form of a broad-based exploration of the visual representations of refugees across a range of media forms. Firstly it suggests that these media images have origins in Christian iconography. Then the discussion considers the treatment of forced migration in the fiction film, proposing that cinema representations often conform to the ’road movie’ genre. A discussion of contemporary issues in the media representation of refugees points to the necessity and direction for future research on the subject.",

    "abstract": "The bureaucrats of New Japan feared the disruptive effects of a complex occidental culture upon a nation regimented by the shogunate. The press, as the carrier of this dynamic force, was closely supervised. The promulgation of opinion, the revelation of ’political secrets,’ and comment in the press upon ’anything, however trifling, connected with our foreign intercourse’ was categorically prohibited. The press evaded the restriction by ironic praise of the administration, by allegories, and by veiled allusions to the despotism practiced by the ministries in Persia and Turkey. Wholesale suppressions of newspapers and imprisonment of editors occurred in 1868, 1876, and 1887. Freedom of speech, press, and assembly was restricted by laws, purposely couched in vague language, which were more rigidly enforced than the strict letter might suggest. The constitution, granted in 1890, accorded a free press ’within the limits of law,’ but imperial ordinances during the Sino-Japanese War and after the Russo-Japanese conflict nullified the grant. Slight improvements have been visible. The ban laid, in 1872, upon ’discussing laws’ has been modified into an injunction against ’reviling laws’ (1875) or against ’undermining the existing governmental and economic system’ (1925). Permanent suppressions may be made only after a court trial, but any one of four ministers may forbid the sale or distribution of any issue. An indefinite and unofficial elasticity of enforcement permits the written law to grow more liberal.",

The typical arrangement entails an exclusive geographic territory assigned by the newspaper company, daily purchase of a number of copies, the number being set by the newspaper company, and resale at a price stipulated by the newspaper –exclusive territory, stipulated resale price and a sales quota. That the newspapers enforce sales quotas, which would violate antimonopoly proscriptions, is widely denied by the newspaper companies but is evidently a fact. The newspapers that are shipped and billed to the distributors, and unwanted by them, are referred to as oshigami–literally “push papers”push papers. Documentation of this practice can be found in the Wikipedia entry for “shinbun hanbai ten”shinbun hanbai ten (newspaper sellers in Japan). It is also usual and expected that the distributors will bepaidbyadvertiserstoincludeinsertsinthepaperstheydistribute. Mostnewsdealersdistribute only one newspaper. The newspaper companies also contract with independent operators besides the newsdealers to solicit new subscriptions.p16 Japan’s leading national newspapers and a dozen of the largest regional and local papers, protected by a special 1953 exemption from antimonopoly law, have persistently kept their monthly subscription prices at the same common level, about 15 percent higher than they would otherwise have set. In doing so they added 16-billion yen per year to their own profit, based on my estimates here, but imposed a ¥300-billion per year burden on the nation.",

    "abstract": "One of the most significant developments in the field of technical communication during the 1980s and 1990s has been a growing interest in international technical communication, including technical communication in Japan. This article provides insights into aspects of the Japanese language and culture that affect Japanese technical communication practices. The authors then use these insights to interpret and report the results of a survey of Japanese aerospace engineers and scientists concerning the kinds of communication products they produce, the kinds they use, and the specific recommendations they would offer to designers of academic programs in technical communication.",

There are still 1.3 million unfilled telephone application’s and there is also a strong demand for complete nationwide subscriber dialing. In order to meet these demands, NTT established a series of five-year expansion programs. On the other hand, all telecommunication services in Japan, such as local and long distance telephone, telegraph, data transmission service, etc., are presently showing remarkable improvement in line with salient technological developments of various electrical communications media.",

Eight American and seven Japanese programs were viewed for ten months during 1973-1974, from which 100 married couples were chosen for content analysis. In relation to the external environment the American family is insulated within the framework of the provincial white middle class, while Japanese characters are broadly intermeshed with society at large. The Japanese family adheres to the goal of family continuity, while the American is based on romantic love. Such a difference in goal orientations affects the types of family integration and pattern maintenance.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the volume of information flow in Japan which is carried by the various media. New statistics were compiled in order to understand the volume of information flow. A new integrated indicator which enables us to compare each of the media with other is composed. This is represented by the unit of ‘word’. The volume of supply of information and the volume of consumption were distinguished. The change of relationship between the supply and the consumption of information was examined by means of time series analysis of the volume of information flow in correlation to the economic and societal indicators. The costs of information flow were estimated. By estimating the distribution cost of the information, it was possible not only to understand the total cost to society for the circulation of information, but also to compare the efficiency of the media by comparing the unit cost of each medium, that is to say, the total cost divided by the total volume of information flow. Analysis of the actual state of information flow and positioning of the media were made in relation to the supply and consumption volume as well as cost of information flow.",

    "abstract": "As a very novel form of life in Japan, apartment life has become the subject of much research by Japanese sociologists in recent years. This paper attempts to examine critically the findings of such research, especially concerning privacy and social life. Two types of apartment dwellers are identified: the ‘sociability type,’ who loves positive human relations resulting from physical propinquity, and the ‘privacy type,’ who recoils from such relations and prefers to be let alone. In a middle-class apartment house complex in the suburbs of Tokyo, the privacy type who, though not necessarily unsociable, does not want mere physical propinquity to determine the choice of his friends and the pattern of his social life, is found more frequently than the sociability type.",

    "abstract": "This article attempts to throw some light on the linkage between television and nationalism in contemporary Japan, focusing on: 1) the historical development of TV as a symbolic object in everyday life; 2) TV as a technology of time–space articulation; and 3) the textual formation of TV programs. By the late 1950s, TV sets were placed not in homes, but on street corners, where large numbers of people gathered. The symbolic meaning of the ‘collective’ nature of TV changed after the 1960s. From the early 1960s onwards, when TV entered households, it became an overarching medium linking the family with the state, defining the national consciousness and dominating people’s imaginative views of both the past and the present. This article analyzes the ideological relationship between gender, technology and nationalism in TV images through the postwar period. But TV also provides a flow of information and discursive structures for the horizons of the social imagination. Thus, the article also shows how TV broadcasting was structured around the three nationwide time zones of morning, midday and evening. Through these time zones, it was possible to link domestic memories with national history via its major programs. The stability of TV as a national medium was threatened in all these dimensions from the late 1980s. Increasingly, media became personalized, transgressive and transnational. Despite the gradual break-up of the stable position of TV in households and the national timetable constructed through broadcasting, more powerful and aggressive national times and discourses have come into being in the face of crises. In the context of this contradictory situation, the dominant central TV stations in Japan today are becoming increasingly stagnant while, on the other hand, the internet and independent video journalism are showing greater dynamism.",

    "abstract": "Based on a qualitative study of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT), this paper argues that the celebrated rise of MPT’s status to a ‘policy’ ministry is best understood in terms of its expanding power of external control. Amakudari is a prized product of such bureaucratic control over firms and works as “spoils” for the regulatory ministry. The extensive web of amakudari that MPT cast, following the “privatization” of Nippon Telephone and Telegraph and the “liberalization” of the telecommunications industry, may well lead to costly policy failure not unlike the jusen and HIV-contaminated blood scandals.",

    "abstract": "For years, the discipline of economics has been moving steadily away from the real world towards formalized axioms and mathematical models with only a precarious bearing on actuality. Commentators seek to fill the gap as best they can, but in the absence of real background scholarship, journalism is vulnerable to the myopias of fashion and immediacy. The deeper enigmas of post-war development remain in either case largely untouched. Bringing together the strengths of both the economist and the historian, Robert Brenner rises to this challenge. In this work, a revised and newly introduced edition of his acclaimed New Left Review special report, he charts the turbulent post-war history of the global system and unearths the mechanisms of over-production and over-competition which lie behind its long-term crisis since the early 1970s, thereby demonstrating the thoroughly systematic factors behind wage repression, high unemployment and unequal development, and raising disturbing and far-reaching questions about its future trajectory.",

    "abstract": "From establishing Confucius Institutes all over the world to mounting an advertising blitz in New York’s Times Square, the Chinese state’s multifaceted endeavour to strengthen its ‘soft power’ has been highly visible and the subject of much recent political, journalistic, and scholarly attention. This paper locates the Chinese state’s ‘soft power’ quest within historical and geopolitical contexts and explores the pro-found contradictions in its underpinning political economy and cultural politics. While this campaign’s state, industry, professional and moral imperatives appear self-evident and there are converging elite and popular interests in the project, its structural impediments seem to be insurmountable. Furthermore, there are irreconcilable tensions between a drive to pursue an elitist, technocratic, and cultural essentialist approach to global communication and a capacity to ar-ticulate and communicate an alternative global political and social vision that appeals to the vast majority of the world population in a deeply divided and crises-laden domestic and global order.",

    "abstract": "The history of radio broadcasting is traced from its earliest origins, through its role as a subversive tool in World War II to the cold war era, and finally to itspresent day use as an instrument of foreign policy used by over 160 countries. The effects on the cold war, in which propoganda broadcasting was the ultimate weapon, contributing in no small measure to the collapse of communism in the USSR, are analysed. The roles of Voice of America, the BBC World Service and others come under scrutiny, and the concluding chapters report on the explosive growth in international broadcasting now taking place in the aftermath of recent political events. The book is supplemented with up-to-date technical data and statistics on major expansions now under way or being planned in many countries, particularly the USA and the Arab states, some of the latter having a broadcasting capacity that dwarfs most western countries. The appeal of the book is by no means restricted to scientists and engineers and many will find much to stir their memories of international radio broadcastsin wartime and peacetime alike.",

    "abstract": "Soft power is the ability to affect others to obtain the outcomes one wants through attraction rather than coercion or payment. A country’s soft power rests on its resources of culture, values, and policies. A smart power strategy combines hard and soft power resources. Public diplomacy has a long history as a means of promoting a country’s soft power and was essential in winning the cold war. The current struggle against transnational terrorism is a struggle to win hearts and minds, and the current overreliance on hard power alone is not the path to success. Public diplomacy is an important tool in the arsenal of smart power, but smart public diplomacy requires an understanding of the roles of credibility, self-criticism, and civil society in generating soft power.",

    "abstract": "Japan is seeking to project its “soft power” through the allure of manga and anime in its public diplomacy. The production, diffusion and global consumption of manga and anime are driven by market forces and consumer tastes and not by the Japanese state. However, the latter is seeking to harness this popular culture to burnish Tokyo’s international image. Despite the attractiveness of Japanese pop culture and other more traditional forms of public diplomacy, Tokyo’s pursuit of “soft power” and a good international image is undermined by its failure to overcome its burden of history. \\[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR\\]",

    "abstract": "This study seeks to identify and test a mechanism through which the Internet influences public support in an authoritarian environment in which alternative information is strictly censored by the state. Through online discussions, web users often interpret sanctioned news information in directions different from or even opposite to the intention of the authoritarian state. This alternative framing on the Internet can strongly affect the political views of web users. Through an experimental study conducted in China, we find that subjects exposed to alternative online framing generally hold lower levels of policy support and evaluate government performance more negatively. This finding implies that even though the access to information on sensitive topics is effectively controlled by the government, the diffusion capabilities of the Internet can still undermine the support basis of the seemingly stable authoritarian regime.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the role of the media in sustaining regime stability in an authoritarian context. The article engages the recent work on authoritarian resilience in comparative politics but goes beyond the standard focus on elections to other important institutions, such as the media and courts, that are used by authoritarian leaders to bolster legitimacy. The authors find that the Chinese media contribute to regime legitimacy and effective rule by propagandizing citizens’ experiences in the legal system. However, unlike the “mouthpieces” of earlier communist regimes, the marketized Chinese media provide more convincing and sophisticated messages that continue to accord with state censorship demands while satisfying readers’ interest in real-life stories and problems. The “positive propaganda” and the relative uniformity of information sources because of state censorship lead aggrieved citizens to the law as a realm for dispute resolution and rights protection. Statistical analysis of a randomly sampled survey conducted in four Chinese cities in 2005 demonstrates that exposure to media reporting about labor-law-related issues successfully promotes the image of a proworker bias in the law among citizens, thus encouraging them to participate in the legal system. The state is able to achieve its political goal because of the lack of conflicting sources of information and the lack of previous experience with the reformed legal system among citizens.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Throughout Asia, states are competing to build and leverage soft power using public diplomacy. This article examines these investments, whether they pay dividends, and why they are being made. A mix of qualitative and quantitative analysis shows little, if any, positive correlation between public diplomacy by Asian states and foreign public opinion. We therefore ask why states invest in public diplomacy when it does not seem to work. We argue that different motives are at play: The struggle for soft power is driven by both a logic of consequences and logic of appropriateness. Lastly, we suggest how this struggle might aggravate rather than ameliorate tensions in the region.",

    "annote": "Reforming Japanese Copyright and Content Distribution Laws: The Commodification of ‘Cool Japan’Cool Japan?Souichirou Kozuka Gakushuin UniversityOctober 28, 2013Abstract: In 2006-2007, a few proposals were made in Japan for the reform of copyright regime. These proposals had a common aim of promoting the distribution of digitised works and facilitating the entertainment industry. The agenda was very unique to Japan, as most other countries were more concerned about the protection and enforcement of copyright in the digital environment (whether good or bad) than the promoted distribution of copyrighted works. After several years, however, the reform failed and the proposals are almost abandoned. Looking back, it appears that the true problems that hindered the distribution of digitalised works were the structure of the industry, such as the absence of new entrants to the distribution channel and the poor working conditions of the creators. The proposals could have had an impact to cure these problems by changing the industry structure, but was protested by the creators, who wished to retain the levy system that they were familiar with. Neither the consumers supported the reform, as they preferred to enjoy the free services on the Internet, whether they were legal or not. Finally, the government gradually turned its policy from the competition-oriented to protective one in late 2000’s. It was because of these backgrounds that the reform proposals were finally abandoned.

    "abstract": "In Japan, civil society uses of online technology have a long history: non-profit computer networks preceded the Internet and webcasting was pioneered by civic groups wanting to overcome rigid broadcasting laws. However, online civil society media face great challenges, with government, market and un-civil society trying to marginalize them against an even more damaging background of general neglect and disregard. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) has proposed a new policy framework for the convergence of telecommunication and broadcasting, the basis for a new law planned for 2010. Varying levels of regulation are foreseen for all content. Online variants of mainstream media such as newspapers and television broadcasting will remain largely self-regulated. Civil society media (CSM) remain unrecognized, facing potentially heavy regulation as ‘user-generated content’. The authors focus on Japanese online civil society media (online CSM), using case studies to ill",

    "abstract": "Tabloidization of news and its potential threat to democracy is a recurring issue in debates among scholars and journalists. Most research focuses on measuring either content or the effects of tabloid-style content and often leaves the antecedents of the content as a ‘black box’. This study compares tabloid journalists to other journalists based on a survey of Danish journalists (N = 1550). It shows that tabloid journalists in many regards hold professional values that differ from the values of other journalists and that they experience different pressures from the organization in which they work. In their journalistic style tabloid journalists emphasize personalization and sensationalist news values more and relevance news values less than other journalists. Finally, tabloid-style journalism is to some extent driven by profit orientation in journalists as well as in their organizations. However, the study also shows that journalists’ adherence to the role as public mobilizer is positively related to personalization, which implies that tabloidization might carry benefits and not only threats to democracy.",

    "abstract": "While alternative media have long been playing important roles in the politics of protests and resistance in many countries, the Internet has led to the emergence of online alternative media and arguably expanded the reach of such outlets. This article focuses on the audience of Internet alternative media. It examines the factors associated with usage and whether and how usage relates to political participation. Analysis of survey data (N = 1,018) in Hong Kong shows that, not surprisingly, Internet alternative media usage was driven by preexisting political attitudes and critical views toward the mainstream media. But social media usage could also drive alternative media usage even among people who did not hold congruent preexisting attitudes. Meanwhile, alternative media usage leads to protest participation and support for unconventional protest tactics. The study thus provides empirical evidence regarding how Internet alternative media can facilitate the formation of an active online counterpublic and the role of social media in potentially enlarging the counterpublic.",

    "abstract": "Wilbur Schramm’s “Soviet” communist model and J. Herbert Altschull’s “Marxist” approach have been widely used as general theoretical frameworks to examine press systems in the Marxist world in general and China in particular. Though a growing literature suggested significant changes in Chinese journalism in the past 2 decades, very few studies have sent a direct challenge to the 2 models’ theoretical wisdom through the Chinese case. This article finds neither of the 2 models is sufficient in conceptualizing the Chinese case because of Chinese news media’s transitional nature and the 2 models’ inner theoretical flaws as normative press theories. Furthermore, realizing the growing conflict between normative media theories and accelerated post-Cold War global media transformation, the author suggests using a transitional media approach to revisit the traditional normative media approach and calls for a more systematic study of the transitional phenomenon of global media systems.",

    "abstract": "Both cross-cultural psychology and theories of value would benefit from the empirical identification of value dimensions that are pancultural and comprehensive. Accordingly, in this article, I report the results of a 21-culture study of the Chinese Value Survey (CVS) and a 9-culture study of the Rokeach Value Survey (RVS). The analysis began with a ’deculturing’ of the data to remove the cultural positioning effect, then proceeded with a pooled factor analysis to discover pancultural patterns of association among the values. Two factors emerged from the CVS, four from the RVS. The individuals in each survey were then given factor scores, which were analyzed for sex and culture effects. Average scores for individuals from the cultures common to both surveys suggest that the CVS contained a dimension of valuing not found in the RVS. The discussion focuses on the factors’ validity, their use in cross-cultural research, and the potential of different cultural traditions for extending psychology’s conceptual net.",

    "abstract": "With American parties finally acting more like those in most other industrial democracies, with lines of ideological dispute clearly drawn, 1995 created an opportunity for the media to move toward their ideal role as civic educators. This case study explains how and why they missed this opportunity, highlighting the impact of the persistent nonideological and nonpartisan biases that structure the news. These biases led journalists to frame the debate over environmental policy reform in ways that prevented the average citizen from engaging in rational deliberation.",

James Potter guides readers through the extensive body of research on the effects of the mass media by organizing the book around two Media Effects Templates. The first template helps organize thinking about media influences on individuals, and the second focuses on media influences on larger social structures and institutions. Throughout the book, Potter encourages students to analyze their own experiences tby searching for evidence of these effects in their own lives, making the content meaningful.",

    "annote": "Over the past years, it has often been stated that the traditional function of journalism will erode with the advance of the ‘information society’. Direct news supply by satellite television and computer networks, the explosion of information and the increasing communication autonomy of citizens, less public service and more commercial exploitation of media all suggest that critical journalism is becoming redundant. This article gives an overview of the relevant developments and discussions on the topic, and defends the thesis that because of the increasing individualization and segmentation in communication such notions as ‘community’ and ‘public debate’ should be taken less for granted. Therefore the traditional task of journalism will shift from collecting information to directing the social flow of information and public debate. Next to this ‘orientating journalism’, the new media offer scope for ‘instrumental journalism’.",

In their own words these news professionals describe the reduction in resources devoted to covering Congress, the downgrading of the State Department and Supreme Courtbeats, news reporters’ conflicts with the Clinton Whitehouse, and the difficulties in obtaining information from government officials of every rank. Often expressing frustration - and even hostility - toward the New York-based executives who ’manage’ the evening news, Washington’s broadcast journalists decry sinking standards, as their ability to inform citizens is sacrificed to material calulated to preserve dwindling audiences.",

Chapter 1 discusses news as a force of information, examines news as a sociological problem, and describes the difficulty of defining news. Chapter 2 discusses the evolution of news content in the American daily press and examines the difference between reprinting and reporting and the diverse meanings of ’objective’ news. Chapter 3 discusses newsmaking as a social process and examines the basis for selecting news beats and news sources and ’being a news source vs. becoming a news source’. Chapter 4 discusses news content as a social product, examines the effect of social values on news values, and measures the limits of media competence. (TS)CHECK DETAILS",

    "abstract": "Japan is widely regarded as a model case of successful language modernization, and it is often erroneously believed to be linguistically homogenous. There is a connection between these two views. As the first ever non-Western language to be modernized, Japanese language modernizers needed to convince the West that Japanese was just as good a language as the national languages of the West. The result was a fervent desire for linguistic uniformity. Today the legacy of modernist language ideology poses many problems to an internationalizing Japan. All indigenous minority languages are heading towards extinction, and this purposefully created homogeneity also affects the integration of immigrants and their languages. This book examines these issues from the perspective of language ideology, and in doing the mechanisms by which language ideology undermines linguistic diversity are revealed.",

    "abstract": "This book offers a most comprehensive characterization of the historical, institutional and economic forces affecting electricity regulation. Eminent economists organized by the University of California Energy Institute survey the USA, UK, Scandinavia, Latin America, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Yugoslavia. Recent experiments with privatization, competition and restructuring in electricity are contrasted with instances where government ownership and traditional vertical integration still dominate. The introductory essay by Richard J. Gilbert, Edward P. Kahn and David Newbery synthesizes individual country studies. In any regulatory system, the government must bargain with investors and consumers to satisfy conflicting interests. The opacity of information about cost constrains this process. Governments also impose multiple political and economic objectives on the electricity industry, which further obscures cost conditions. Privatization and deregulation tend to reverse these effects. Few countries, however, have managed to sustain private ownership in the long run.",

While most Balinese use the absolute frame of reference provided by their language and culture, a relative (egocentric) encoding is also used, and the flexibility with which Balinese can switch from one encoding to the other increases with age. The study thus provides empirical evidence for moderate linguistic relativity.",

Here, however, the name of the game is not bingo but oshigami: literally, push-paper, but in plain English, the hard sell. The fighting tactics have become sufficiently dirty for Japan’s Fair Trade Commission to deliver a stiff warning to the newspapers and their distributors to stop the feuding or risk legal reprisals.Oshigami definition:Sales tactics -Oshigami is one such tactic. By its strict definition it describes the system whereby newspapers send their distributors more copies of the paper than were ordered. The distributor is forced to use whatever means he can to find customers for the extra copies because he has to pay for them; he dare not return them unsold for fear of incurring the wrath of the newspaper and losing his distribution contract. For the 70 per cent of distributors who have exclusive contracts with one newspaper, this would mean the loss of their livelihood.",

This study seeks to bring this resource into the remit of systematic analysis. Data are taken from screen measurements of portrayals of social actors in news programming produced by two national broadcasters, NHK in Japan and the BBC in the UK. Results for these two media outlets are compared and an attempt made to place the results in a meaningful cultural context. Analysis focuses on NHK’s images and the less familiar Japanese media system.",

    "abstract": "The article explores the impact of Internet on the government worldwide. It discusses a brief overview on cyber-utopianism, a naïve belief in the emancipatory nature of online communication that rests on a stubborn refusal to acknowledge its downside. It relates the importance of Internet to bring out political corruption and other political issues. It explores the role of Internet in Middle Eastern democratic revolutions. It explains how Russian government handles or control the Internet and civic activism. It suggests several roles of cyber-realists in handling the Internet.",

    "abstract": "The switch to digital terrestrial broadcasting on 24 July 2011 marked a watershed for the broadcasting industry in Japan. Digitalisation is the single largest industry-wide event since the advent of alternative distribution technologies, satellite and cable, in the 1980s. Preparation for the switch to digital, known as chideji-ka, has put existing business arrangements under pressure and has led to a renewed focus on the future shape of the industry. There is increasing acknowledgement that change, especially in the relationship between central and local broadcasters, is inevitable. This paper summarises the position of the industry at the beginning of its digital age, arguing for a new view of broadcasting in Japan that recognises the two-tier reality behind industry rhetoric. It also summarises the major options open to the industry as it looks to redefine itself in a much-changed media environment.",

    "abstract": "The global media play a fundamental role in contemporary globalization, making possible instant communication and promoting an experience of global connectedness. The globalization of media communications has deeply shaped the modern journalistic field in the last 150 years and, at the same time, global news organizations have been instrumental in creating the very conditions that have made globalization possible. In this article I explore the relationship between globalization and the media and trace the historical development of the field of global news, examining in detail the role and trajectories of its most important players, the global news agencies, and highlighting significant parallels between nineteenth-century globalization and the processes that have led to increased global connectedness in the past decades. I also devote some attention to the more recent developments in the field of global news and the appearance of new types of media organizations.",

    "abstract": "The success of a democracy depends, in part, on public demand for democratic institutions. How does Internet use shape citizens’ preferences for regime type? Combining individual public opinion data from Africa and Asia with country-level indices, we test a multilevel model examining the relationship between Internet penetration, individual Internet use, and citizen demand for democracy across 28 countries. We find that Internet use, but not national Internet penetration, is associated with greater citizen commitment to democratic governance. Furthermore, greater democratization and Internet penetration moderates the relationship between Internet use and demand for democracy.",

    "abstract": "Linkages between countries have changed significantly as the global information infrastructure has evolved over the past decade. We argue that communication infrastructure and political processes evolve together, and in this study we attempt to measure key structural changes in bandwidth and the centrality of digital nodes in Middle East and North Africa. Using a combination of bandwidth metrics and centrality indicators, we demonstrate how global information infrastructure evolved between 2002 and 2010, and how several countries in the Middle East rose to prominence as good nodes mediating strong intraregional networks.",

    "abstract": "Translating content from one media platform to another, a process here dubbed content streaming, is the leitmotif of contemporary globalized media. Yet widely divergent interpretations of the phenomenon have emerged. Academic political economy interprets content streaming as powerfully inimical to cultural diversity, media competition and freedom of speech. Mainstream business reporting, working from an opposing media economics schema, pillories ‘synergy’-based content strategies as oversold in theory and unworkable in practice. Challenging this established trend for the disciplines to develop in parallel, the article harnesses mainstream critique of content streaming to political economy’s traditionally circumspect view of corporate media. Examining first the commercial rationales for pursuing content streaming, before turning to the financial and managerial constraints on realizing these goals, the article positions content streaming as less all-pervasive than political economists have feared, but more commercially entrenched than the financial press currently allows.",

Hall’s work at the Foreign Service Institute. This article reviews intercultural communication research as it is published by communication journals, and examines how culture is conceptualized in intercultural communication research. Alternate ways in which “culture” might be conceptualized are then discussed and the consequences that this might have for intercultural communication scholarship are explored.",

    "abstract": "This article analyses Ali G through the concept of ‘liquid racism’. As a polysemic and elusive form, liquid racism requires reflexivity in order to critique it fully, and is a racism that, in media representation, often polarizes debate of its meaning. The article explains how academics have struggled to explain Ali G’s relationship to racism, how his ambiguity is complicated by some social actors seeing him as a real person, before it explains how Ali G expresses three strands of liquid racism. These are ‘postmodern minstrelsy’ — Ali G as a black man, ‘ethnocultural hybrid racism’ — Ali G as a white man pretending to be black, and ‘anti-Asian racism’ — Ali G as an Asian man pretending to be black. It is the combination of the three and the erasure they inflict on one another that creates liquidity. Finally, some non-racist themes in Baron Cohen’s comedy are outlined that encourage analytic confusion.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a method for analysis of cognitive processes during viewing of television commercials(CM’s). In this analysis method, we first identify semantic roles of elements appearing in each CM scene. Corresponding to those roles, we describe each CM scene in a semantic network form, and calculate semantic distances between any two scene elements. In this study, semantic distance refers to the scale of semantic similarity. Based on semantic distances and viewers’ eye movement data, we define two measurements(rate of semantic deviation and semantic transition)relating to how viewers direct their attention to each CM. Viewers’ cognitive processes are evaluated quantitatively based on the two measurements. A series of experiments was carried out to obtain eye movement data as well as individual attributes data(such as ages, preferences towards advertised products, and so forth)during viewing of brand-new CM’s. The experiments were held within a week of those CM’s broadcast debut. Applying the analysis method using the two measurements based on semantic structure of CM scenes to data obtained in the experiments, we could confirm that the proposed analysis method is able to detect individual differences in cognitive processes. In addition, there are implications that the CM design parameters(such as number of scene elements used)and the individual attributes(such as product preferences)may affect those differences. Considering these results, our analysis model seems to be appropriate as a useful method for the pre-evaluation of alternatives for a new CM by advertising companies.",

    "abstract": "We investigated how visual experience with faces of a particular race affects subordinate group-level categorizations in Chinese and Israeli participants living in the respective countries. Categorization of faces by race, gender, and age was examined within subjects with participants who had only minimal experience with the other-race faces. As would be predicted by the previously documented other-race advantage effect, both Chinese and Israeli participants classified the race of the face more quickly and more accurately for other-race than for own-race faces. In contrast, the observers’ race did not interact with the race of the rated face either for gender or for age categorization. The absence of these interactions suggests that the physiognomic characteristics that determine the gender and age of a face are universal, rather than race specific. Furthermore, these data suggest that determining the race of a face is not imposed as a first step in face processing, preempting the perception of other category-defining physiognomic characteristics.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Previous parts of this paper have been concerned with two areas in the syntax of the English clause: Part 1 with transitivity, Part 2 with theme. Transitivity is defined as relating to the experiential component of meaning (or , though this term is not really appropriate since all components involve a cognitive stratum); the discussion has been confined to the expression of processes and the participants therein although a full treatment of the experiential component in the syntax of the clause would take account of other features, the expression of time and place and other adjuncts to and conditions on the process. Theme is related to the discoursal, or informational, component; under this heading are brought together the principal options whereby the speaker introduces structure into the discourse and (in the ideal case) ensures the recognition of the text as a text, and its interpretation along predicted lines.",

    "abstract": "Talk about time is commonly accompanied by co-speech gesture. Though much recent work has looked at how time is construed as space in the languages of the world, few studies have examined temporal gestures in any detail. Our focus is on a particular pattern among American English speakers transversal temporal gestures in which time is conceptualized as moving from left to right across the body. Based on numerous examples elicited in a controlled observational paradigm, we suggest a classification of American English speakers’ transversal temporal gestures into five types placing, pointing, duration-marking, bridging, and animating and provide examples of each type. Discussion focuses on the following three topics: the usefulness of quasi-experimental approaches for the study of gesture; variation in temporal gestures across cultures; and how temporal gestures fit into a broader understanding of metaphorical gestures.",

    "abstract": "In order to characterize and explain regional formation processes, theories in the field of international relations have focused primarily on political and economic parameters that were drawn from experiences in Western Europe. In East Asia, however, it is often mentioned that ’regional dynamism’ and cross-border economic activities, rather than formal agreements between governments, or shared historical or cultural ’Asian’ background generates the formation of the region. This article, however, examines the role popular culture plays in shaping and regionalizing East Asia. It focuses on the process by which confluences of culture have diffused throughout East Asian markets in the decades surrounding the 1990s and the concurrent formation of regional media alliances. An attempt is made to go beyond state-centric explanations of regionalization and extend the cultural approach to regionalization, demonstrating how popular culture can affect regional formation.",

    "abstract": "Since the 1980s, popular cultural products have criss‐crossed the national borders of East Asian countries, enabling a discursive construction of an ‘East Asian Popular Culture’ as an object of analysis. The present essay is a preliminary attempt to provide some conceptual and analytic shape to this object, delineated by its three constitutive elements of production, distribution and consumption. Each East Asian location participates in different and unequal levels in each of these component processes. Production can either be located entirely in a single geographic location or, alternatively, each of the necessary constituent sub‐processes can be executed from different locations; preference for either arrangement tends to reflect the relative dominance of the production location in exporting its finished products. Consumption and thus consumers are geographically located within cultural spaces in which they are embedded. Meanings and viewing pleasures are generated within the local cultures of specific audience. Conceptually, among the several possible consumption positions, the one in which an audience watches an imported programme is most intriguing. In this viewing position, differences between the cultures of the location of consumption and that of the production location become most apparent. The audience member has to bring his or her own cultural context to bear on the content of the imported product and read it accordingly. In this sense, the cultural product may be said to have crossed a ‘cultural’ boundary, beyond the simple fact of its having been exported/imported into a different location as an economic activity. Such an audience position requires the consumer to transcend his or her grounded nationality to forge abstract identification with the foreign characters on screen, a foreignness that is, in turn, potentially reabsorbed into an idea of (East) ‘Asia’; a potential ‘East Asian identity’, emerging from consumption of popular cultural products, is thus imaginable.",

It just comes as somewhat of a surprise to learn that in some cases old rather than new technologies were used to propel the expanding Tokugawa communication industry. This shogunate did experiment with a new technology movable type early in the theatre using pressings confiscated from the Koreans by Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s invading troops in the 1590s. The imperial family had copies of the classic of filial piety and Nihon Shoki Chronicles of Japan printed on these presses and Ieyasu reportedly gave 300,000 pieces of wooden movable type to the Ashikaga family to reproduce old manuscripts and had another 200,000 copper types in 1614. But to the complex city of the Kanji Chinese characters used in Japanese writing and the aesthetic sterility of materials produced by interchangeable type fonts disturbed most Tokugawa era printers; so after a few years they threw out the printing presses just as they discarded the foreign guns and religions and shifted back to the traditional slate and woodblock techniques.",

SEEL, 1998 Ames, Iowa State University Press pp. xix + 310, USD49.95 (hardcover)One of the most significant events in the history of broadcasting has been the development of high-definition television (HDTV). Not only has it resulted in a revolution in technology, it has changed the very paradigms of industry structure and regulation itself. Yet, despite great technological advances, economic realities continue to raise questions about HDTV’s future. In their 1998 book, High-Definition Television: a global perspective, Michael Dupagne and Peter B. Seel offer an international look at the historical, political, technological and economic factors that lead to the development of an advanced, digital television standard. Though the prevailing Grand Alliance system was developed through an-at times competitive, at times cooperative-effort between primarily US companies and the FCC’s Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Service (ACATS), HDTV is truly a product of historical and international events. Conversely, though the Grand Alliance system is technically a US standard adopted by the FCC, its effects have had international consequences. The authors attempt to review these events both chronologically and thematically. Their attention to detail and writing style promises something of value for both the specialist as well as the lay reader.The book treats the very complex issue of policy development by dividing the issues into relevant components. Chapter I gives an overview of HDTV’s development for the last 30 years. Though ‘high definition’high definition is a relative term referring to preceding technology (i.e. SMPTE was ‘high definition’high definition compared to than original attempts to broadcast images), the Japanese are credited for pioneering many of the current HDTV specifications. This chapter takes the reader through these original developments to the historical and political issues that led to the failure of Japan’s MUSE system as an international standard at the CCIR Plenary Assembly in Dubrovnik in 1986. After Dubrovnik, the US policy toward MUSE would change from support to concern to direct competition. Consideration of various economic, political and historical factors help explain the failure for a single international standard.Chapter 2, entitled, ‘Global HDTV production,’Global HDTV production, looks at HDTV’s production qualities. The authors discuss the various systems that have been proposed over the years (e.g. MAC, MUSE, EDTV, etc.). This is a great chapter for the novice trying to understand a little bit more about what makes HDTV different from current television sets in terms of aesthetics. For those who already have an understanding of this, the chapter offers additional information into the various influences that resulted in the current 16:9 aspect ratio and the line and field standards for HDTV. For instance, what were the original ratios? And why was 16:9 originally chosen? It also includes some discussion on how HDTV will change the way television productions are shot. At first glance, this chapter seems to stand somewhat apart from the overall theme of the book; the authors address the issues in such a way as to illustrate the international issues involved, but they provide a unique view of how various cultural and political factors throughout the world played a factor in some of these decisions.The next three chapters (Chapters 3-6) focus respectively on the three major regimes-Japan, Europe and the US-involved in developing HDTV. Some of the issues and events introduced in Chapter 1 are revisited but with greater detail and with each chapter analyzing the political, historical, and cultural attributes of its particular regime for explanations as to why events unfolded as they did. What social and economic issues besides technological advantage roused Japan’s interest in HDTV? Why was MUSE unable to gain acceptance in Europe and the US? Why did European countries oppose Japan’s MUSE standard at Dubrovnik? What lead to the ultimate failure of the EU’s attempt at a European HDTV standard? How did international developments create a conflict of interest for some European owned electronic manufacturers? Why did the US change its position regarding Japan’s system after Dubrovnik? What political battles in Washington affected the outcome of HDTV? The three chapters address these and other questions.While Chapter 5 looks at ‘HDTV industrial policy in the United States,’HDTV industrial policy in the United States, Chapter 6 focuses on ‘HDTV policymaking in the United States.’HDTV policymaking in the United States. Though the two chapter titles appear very similar, Chapter 6 is more concerned with examining the relationship of six key policy groups-the FCC regulators, the Legislative Branch, the Executive Branch, the judicial Branch, citizen groups and regulated industry-which are identified by the Krasnow, Longely and Terry policy-making model. The chapter first looks at each group’s involvement in HDTV. The authors then use game theory to study ‘the influence of other games being played in parallel with the HDTV standardization process’the influence of other games being played in parallel with the HDTV standardization process (p. 186) on the HDTV process itself and to identify the various winners, losers, rules and goals of the game throughout several ‘key policy decisions.’key policy decisions.Chapter 7 focuses particularly on ACATS’ role in the HDTV policy-making process. The Krasnow, et aL model is used for macro-level analysis of how the different parties interacted with ACATS to develop a standard. Game theory is used to analyze the actions of individuals at a micro-level. Although the chapter does not go to great length discussing capture theory, it is clear that ACATS was very dependent upon industry for information and member volunteers. The authors also point out the failure to include on the committee serious involvement from consumer advocacy groups and non-broadcasting industry groups (i.e. the computer industry).Chapter 8, entitled, ‘HDTV economics,’HDTV economics, explores the economics surrounding the three divisions of broadcasting: production, transmission and reception. Of particular value in this chapter is a very thorough documentation of experiments performed in the US, Europe and Japan since the 1980s to determine station conversion costs, market potential of HDTV and consumer acceptance. The chapter concludes with six empirical propositions concerning consumer adoption based on the experiments and argues that there is little reason to believe that HDTV will not eventually diffuse as rapidly as color TV despite initial ’lukewarm’ reactions.In the final chapter, the authors examine the usefulness of traditional policy-making models, which tend to depend on national or regional attributes. The HDTV policy process is very useful in examining the strengths and weaknesses of such models at an international level. While the Krasnow et al. model is ‘the most relevant and inclusive framework for studying HDTV standardization in the United States,’the most relevant and inclusive framework for studying HDTV standardization in the United States, it fails to take into account various factors that are illustrated by the HDTV process. The authors offer several modifications to the Krasnow et aL model that better account for the actual interaction of participants within the US as well as influences at a global level.With a few exceptions, the reader should not expect to find in this book an overly detailed account of individual players or events as in some historical accounts of HDTV. However, it does offer a very thorough and broad overview of the HDTV process, presenting a clear picture of the international factors involved. It also provides a highly referenced resource of HDTV related literature. If there is a weakness to the book, it may be that chapters tend to repeat historical information from a previous chapter to provide context and it is at unclear that events in different regions occurred simultaneously. Consequently, the book may at times feel somewhat repetitive or disjointed. This could be due in part to the authors’ attempt to approach ‘HDTV in both a chronological and a thematic order’HDTV in both a chronological and a thematic order (p. 3). In all fairness, this may not be completely avoidable. The authors attempt a Herculean task of capturing a snapshot of a very dynamic process involving highly complex and multilevel interrelationships. Overall the book offers a very valuable resource to the policy-making literature and a historical documentation of HDTV as well. AuthorAffiliationR.

Taiwanese youth use the Internet to a much greater extent than Japanese youth, even though broadband services are cheaper and faster in previous termJapannext term. Japanese youth use text-messaging services featured on mobile phones more than their Taiwanese counterparts. Since the 1980s, Taiwan has witnessed the development of a unique BBS (bulletin board system) culture, and this culture has led the Taiwanese to have a comparatively stronger degree of trust in the Internet than the Japanese. The Internet culture in previous termJapannext term is more individualized. Japanese adolescents and young adults tend to avoid direct communication, resulting in the promotion of a unique mobile media culture among the Japanese youth. The findings discussed here suggest that, despite the worldwide standardization of communication technologies, the culturally different personal relationship patterns in the two countries studied have created different media trends for their youth.",

    "abstract": "We study three corporate nonmarket strategies designed to influence the lobbying behavior of other special interest groups: (1) astroturf, in which the firm covertly subsidizes a group with similar views to lobby when it normally would not; (2) the bear hug, in which the firm overtly pays a group to alter its lobbying activities; and (3) self-regulation, in which the firm voluntarily limits the potential social harm from its activities. All three strategies reduce the informativeness of lobbying, and all reduce the payoff of the public decision-maker. We show that the decision-maker would benefit by requiring the public disclosure of funds spent on astroturf lobbying but that the availability of alternative influence strategies limits the impact of such a policy.",

    "abstract": "This article aims to be a stock-taking exercise of the development of paradigms and foci of interest, in attempts to theorise the vast developments and far-reaching changes as well as the impact and effects of global communication in the world of today. Attention is firstly given to the current nature, impact and implications of global communication in the first decade of the 21st century, as well as to a shift in emphases in the (sub)discipline of international communication. A critical overview is then given of discourses on the free flow of information, modernisation theory, dependency theory, the structural theory of imperialism, world system theory, hegemony, political economy, critical theory, the public sphere, cultural studies, the information society and globalisation. Since many of these paradigms have been borrowed or taken over from media studies, international relations or other (sub)disciplines, attention is given specifically to their application in theorising international communication. The article concludes with a critical overview of the current ‘state of the art’ with regard to the body of theory in international communication.",

In addition, each local broadcaster provides services under different environmental conditions, such as the geography of the service area. Taking the functional structure of broadcasters and heterogeneity across broadcasters into consideration, this article measures the organizational and sectional efficiencies using a network data envelopment analysis (DEA) model that incorporates these environmental factors. The results clearly reveal differences in the performance of broadcasters compared with the results obtained from ordinary DEA. \\[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR\\]",

    "abstract": "In this article, I examine two contemporary cases in which the same foreign adversary, North Korea (DPRK), violated the sovereignty of neighboring states. I use a comparison of South Korean and Japanese reactions to political captivity to assess institutional performance in democratic states and ways in which these dynamics are connected to international politics. We see how “captivity narratives” can be differentially constructed and deployed and how policy capture can be achieved by determined political actors. Civic groups in both countries worked to mobilize political support, frame the issue for the media, and force policy change. In Japan, politicians were more willing to use the abduction issue for domestic political gain than in Korea, where the political class was determined to prevent human rights issues (including abductions) from interfering with their larger political agenda, including improved relations with the DPRK.",

    "abstract": "Consistent left-right and right-left reading habits are associated with corresponding directional tendencies in the reproduction of horizontally displayed visual stimuli. Inconsistent reading habits should therefore be associated with inconsis tent directional tendencies. This hypothesis was tested on Japanese readers whose reading habits were inconsistent by asking them to reproduce four series of 12-item horizontal stimulus arrays. The hypothesis was partially supported by the data which showed that, like Hebrew readers who also have inconsistent reading habits, the directional tendencies shown by the 68 Japanese readers were significantly weaker on some tasks that those shown by the 16 English readers whose left-right reading habits were consistent. The data were interpreted as showing that acquired reading habits may affect directionality in perception of visual stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual asymmetries for tasks involving aesthetic preference or line bisection can be affected by asymmetrical neurological mechanisms or left/right reading habits. This study investigated the relative contribution of these mechanisms in 100 readers of Japanese and English.Participants made aesthetic judgments between pairs of mirror-reversed pictures showing: (a) static objects, (b) moving objects and (c) landscapes.A line bisection task was also administered. There was a strong effect of reading direction for static and mobile objects whereby Japanese readers preferred objects with a right-to-left directionality (and vice versa for English readers). In contrast, similar patterns were observed for the Japanese and English readers for the landscape and line bisection tasks. The results show that reading habits affect aesthetic judgments for static and moving object tasks, but not the landscape and line bisection tasks. The difference between the tasks may be related to the horizontal/vertical geometry of the stimuli, which makes the landscape and line bisection tasks more prone to universal effects related to cerebral dominance.",

Ss were given titles for each of the 15 stimulus pairs and asked to select the member of the pair to which the title was better suited. Ss consistently (p \\< .01) selected photographs for which titles referred specifically to the left rather than right foreground (p \\< .01). Results confirm previous observations that lateral organization is important for aesthetic appreciation of 2-dimensional art forms. Perceived depth was greater in the left sides of pictures than the right, but attempts to relate left-side title preference to depth per se were not successful.

    "abstract": "The present article suggests that expressions of Japanese identity may be more malleable and receptive to international influences than is usually thought. Through a study of the evolution of images printed on Japanese banknotes and of the political processes behind that evolution, the article shows Japanese state elites consciously following international models of identity content. In particular, it describes the shifts in Japanese banknote iconography in the early 1980s and again in the early 2000s as the product of a drive for conformity with the iconographic norms of European currencies. The state has been the main protagonist in this story, but for a full accounting of the magnitude and pace of iconographic change on the yen, it is necessary to unpack the “black box” of the state.",

    "abstract": "There is largely a consensus that the policy goal of the broadcasting law is to maintain plurality. However, the approach to achieve this goal has been the subject of controversies in many countries, especially since the United States adopted the market-oriented approach. On the other hand, a question about how effectively the system works to achieve the goal under the adopted approach has been largely neglected. This paper argues that this issue can be analyzed by focusing on the agency problem within broadcasting entities and analyzes the recent attempts of regulatory reforms in Japan as a case study. The analysis shows that the Japanese regulator is confusingly swaying between strengthening of the regulation and liberalizing in reliance on market discipline.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes the electronic newspaper’s market structure. The market is characterized by low barriers to entry. Based on the information versus advertising and local versus long-distance distinctions, four submarkets are identified. Within each, competition of different natures (intermedia and intramedia) dominates, yet all four markets fall into the monopolistic competitive market structure, whereas firms compete with one another by product differentiation. Under intermedia competition, we suggest electronic newspapers differentiate themselves from traditional media by developing Internet-related features. Under intramedia competition, content matters more. \\[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR\\]",

    "abstract": "Advertising space is not a homogeneous commodity but something whose value depends on the characteristics of a newspaper’s readership. It is suggested, in particular, that the proportion of readers belonging to the more affluent social categories will exert a strong positive influence on advertising. This paper investigates the circulation/readership-profile relation using a simple simultaneous equation framework. The model is then estimated across a sample of British and Irish daily and Sunday newspapers, using data collected from industry sources. The paper then seeks to quantify the trade-off between circulation and the proportion of high income readers. \\[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR\\]",

    "abstract": "Readers of Japanese must constantly switch between decoding two types of script, Kana and Kanji. Does this incur a measurable processing cost? In four discrete-trial reaction time experiments, with an inter-trial interval of 1s or 2s, Japanese readers had to switch predictably, every second trial, between reading words in Kanji and Kana (Hiragana in three experiments, Katakana in the fourth). The task was naming in two experiments, and semantic categorisation in two. In every case performance was significantly slower, by about 13 ms on average, and less accurate, on the trials following a change of script. In these and three further experiments we show that the cost does not arise from changes in spatial extent, number of characters, or the familiarity of words written in the two scripts, that neither the task nor the direction of switching have much impact on the cost, and that there is no cost for switching between naming words in the two Kana scripts, Hiragana and Katakana. We conclude that to decode Kana and Kanji draws on somewhat different resources, and speculate on the source of the switch cost.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Across cultures people construct spatial representations of time. However, the particular spatial layouts created to represent time may differ across cultures. This paper examines whether people automatically access and use culturally specific spatial representations when reasoning about time. In Experiment 1, we asked Hebrew and English speakers to arrange pictures depicting temporal sequences of natural events, and to point to the hypothesized location of events relative to a reference point. In both tasks, English speakers (who read left to right) arranged temporal sequences to progress from left to right, whereas Hebrew speakers (who read right to left) arranged them from right to left, replicating previous work. In Experiments 2 and 3, we asked the participants to make rapid temporal order judgments about pairs of pictures presented one after the other (i.e., to decide whether the second picture showed a conceptually earlier or later time-point of an event than the first picture). Participants made responses using two adjacent keyboard keys. English speakers were faster to make “earlier” judgments when the “earlier” response needed to be made with the left response key than with the right response key. Hebrew speakers showed exactly the reverse pattern. Asking participants to use a space-time mapping inconsistent with the one suggested by writing direction in their language created interference, suggesting that participants were automatically creating writing-direction consistent spatial representations in the course of their normal temporal reasoning. It appears that people automatically access culturally specific spatial representations when making temporal judgments even in nonlinguistic tasks.",

Eye movement research, which directly records scanning behavior, has traditionally employed Western subjects. The present experiment used eye movement photography to study cultural influences on visual scanning patterns. Thirty adult subjects were tested, representing the Western, Middle Eastern, and East Asian cultures. Data on location of fixations and direction of saccades (horizontal or vertical and right to left or left to right) were collected. No significant differences were found for location of fixations. Data on the direction of saccades revealed significant differences, all of which reflected the reading habits of the different cultures. These data corroborated the results of previous cross-cultural studies.",

We assess that hypothesis in three related studies: a Monte-Carlo analysis of eye placement in synthetic faces randomly placed within a frame; a survey of eye position in 786 painted portraits from Western art of the past six centuries; and an experimental study in which fifty subjects were asked which of two versions of 60 pairs of portraits they preferred, in only one of which the eye was precisely centred. Taken together, the three studies showed no evidence to support Tyler’s hypothesis, and in particular there was no evidence for subjects having an aesthetic preference for a centred eye in portraits. We conclude that one eye tends to be relatively close to the vertical midline because of geometric constraints on the placing of a relatively large object, the head, within a pictorial frame.",

Strings of smaller magnitude number words were bisected further to the left than strings of larger magnitude number words. The current study investigated whether the left-to-right mental number line associated with number processing will result in similar spatial biases despite a habitual, right-to-left reading direction. Monolingual left-to-right readers were compared to bidirectional readers of English and Hebrew. Strings of Arabic numerals and of number words (e.g., THREE, EIGHT) were presented in separate conditions of English and Hebrew. Significant rightward biases were seen among native Hebrew readers, regardless of English reading level; whereas native English readers (both bidirectional and monodirectional) did not show significant biases to either the left or the right. The spatial bias in bisecting either Arabic numeral strings or number words was related to the habitual reading direction of the participant. There was no difference in spatial bias or for frequency of spatial bias based on numerical magnitude for either condition. We discuss the influence of cultural factors, such as reading direction and proficiency, on the representation of spatial and numerical material.",

    "abstract": "An exhaustive qualitative (vote-counting) review is conducted of the literature concerning visual and non-visual line bisection in neurologically normal subject populations. Although most of these studies report a leftward bisection error (i.e., pseudoneglect), considerable between-study variability and inconsistency characterize this literature. A meta-analysis of this same literature is performed in which the total quantitative data set, comprising 73 studies (or sub-studies) and 2191 subjects, is analyzed with respect to 26 performance factors. The meta-analytic results indicate a significant leftward bisection error in neurologically normal subjects, with an overall effect size of between -0.37 and -0.44 (depending on integration method), which is significantly modulated to varying degrees by a number of additional task or subject variables. For example, visual bisection tasks, midsagittal-pointing tasks and tactile bisection tasks all lead to leftward errors, while kinesthetic tasks result in rightward errors. Tachistoscopic forced-choice testing methods reveal much greater estimates of bisection error (effect size=-1.32) than do manual method-of-adjustment procedures (effect size=-0.40). Subject age significantly modulates line bisection performance such that older subjects err significantly rightward compared to younger subjects, and to veridical line midpoint. Male subjects make slightly larger leftward errors than do female subjects. Handedness has a small effect on bisection errors, with dextrals erring slightly further to the left than sinistral subjects. The hand used to perform manual bisection tasks modulated performance, where use of the left hand lead to greater leftward errors than those obtained using the right hand. One of the most significant factors modulating bisection error is the direction in which subjects initiate motor scanning (with either eye or hand), where a left-to-right scan pattern leads to large leftward errors while a right-to-left scan pattern leads to rightward errors.",

Uncertainty about the cash value and potential alternative uses of spectrum is natural given rapid technological change, but the common potential broadcasting uses include mobile television, high definition digital terrestrial television, and more digital broadcasters and channels, including regional and local developments.Research limitations/implications – The study is restricted to Europe, Japan and North America.Practical implications – The study has implications for assessment of European switchover strategies and role of Digital Terrestrial.Originality/value – There are some overviews, but none of so up to date, nor with this geographical coverage.",

    "annote": "ws stories were content analyzed to measure the presence of sensationalist features. In addition, the stories were watched and evaluated by participants to measure the degree to which the items elicited emotional arousal and the degree to which the items were liked. As predicted, the findings showed that emotional arousal mediates effects of sensationalist features on liking and that the relationship between emotional arousal and liking takes the shape of an inverted U. Keywords: sensationalism; television news; emotional arousal; limited capacity model; activation model O ver the past decades, television viewers in both the United States and Europe have witnessed an increasing number of sensationalist features in television news programs (Hendriks Vettehen, Nuijten, & Beentjes, 2005; Hjarvard, 2000; Hvitfelt, 1994; Scott & Gobetz, 1992; Slattery, Doremus, & Marcus, 2001; Slattery & Hakanen, 1994). In journalistic and scientific discourse, the increases in sensation- alism have generally been attributed to the mechanisms of market-driven journalism. According to this line of thought, competition in the news market increasingly poses problems to news producers in how to attract the audiences that are needed for jour- nalistic and economic purposes. Increasing the amount of sensationalism in the news is considered a convenient means to this end (e.g., Bird, 2000; McManus, 1994). The successes of sensationalist television news programs and tabloid newspapers provide an obvious reason for the widespread belief in the power of sensationalism. However, self-evident as these successes may seem, from a scientific point of view they merely represent zero-order correlations between sensationalism and viewing ratings. Consequently, knowledge about the appeal of sensationalist news is limited.

    "abstract": "Does market-driven journalism lead to sensationalism in television news ? To define sensationalism, this study draws upon existing theoretical contributions (Grabe et al.,2001, 2003; Vettehen et al., 2005). The paper compares the level of sensationalism on 24 news channels in 11 countries (9504 news items) and tries to find explanations between them. Therefore, the theoretical model of Kleemans et al. (2008)is adapted, which is based on factors on two levels (broadcaster level and national level). The paper adds a third level, the journalistic level to explain sensationalism on item level. Multivariate analysis shows clear evidence that sensationalism is a tool of market-driven journalism across countries.",

    "abstract": "The study of intercultural differences in personal space attempts to identify factors that could be helpful in guiding people from different cultures to live and work together in international ventures. The objective of this research was to measure interpersonal distance in a cross-cultural environment. Twenty-three participants classified in 4 cultural groups answered an 11-questions interview where the personal distance and orientation between seated interactants were measured. Results showed that Anglo Saxons used the largest zone of personal space, followed by Asians, then Caucasians, and, as expected, Mediterraneans and Latinos used the shortest distance. Where Latinos adopt a face-to-face position, Caucasians tend to orient themselves to the side of the interviewer, which has an impact on interpersonal communication.",

Reading his conquest of Yamato as an expansion of imperial rule, a process destined to continue until it encompassed the entire world, this view recast the nation’s founding myth into a charter for holy war. These changes are examined through an analysis of a tower bearing the slogan, erected in 1940 in Miyazaki, to commemorate the 2,600th anniversary of Jimmu’s ascension.",

    "abstract": "One of the major issues related to the globalisation of advertising in Asia is the degree to which it is mediated by local realities. In Japan, the presence of the so-called global agencies is very limited, and very often global advertisers based in Japan, such as Sony and Toyota, work with Japan mega-agencies for domestic advertising while relying on global agencies for most of the markets outside Japan. Why does such a division exist between the Japanese market and elsewhere? This article first addresses this question, and then proceeds to discuss recent changes in the behaviour of both the media and their audiences, and the challenges they pose to the advertising industry. Such changes are universal, but their threats to the advertising business are more acutely felt in Japan because of its peculiar business structure, as will be described. The article concludes with a discussion of the prospects for the Japanese advertising industry.",

These ’communities of practice’ employ a model of learning akin to apprenticeship, stressing imitation and repetition while socializing students into values and behavior demanded in adult society, notably in terms of a hierarchy of seniors (senpai) and juniors (kōhai). In sports clubs, values associated with ’spiritual education’ (seishin kyōiku) are often prominent. Club participation promotes school order, aided by ritual, routine, and the often intense emotional attachment and group spirit engendered in club activities. Understanding ’bukatsudō’ illuminates the nature of order, selfhood, human development, and learning in Japan.",

    "abstract": "We argue that the most significant and influential research on television over the past five decades positions the medium as a key site for addressing the complex interrelationship between culture and institutional/organizational power. Granting that such work is theoretically and methodologically diverse, we employ an organizational frame that groups political-economic approaches on the one hand and cultural approaches on the other. Political-economic approaches largely attend to issues of power at a macro level, focusing on how ownership and control of television along with the organization of television production practices shape and influence content; cultural approaches focus more on the expressive and symbolic dimensions of television programming and reception. At the same time, contemporary changes in the medium threaten to make past research on television appear quaint and anachronistic. The industry’s transformation of television into continually emerging sets of multifaceted digital-interactive technologies challenges researchers to draw enduring perspectives from the older work and assess how they apply to the new-media environment. Consequently, we suggest the term “video cultures” in lieu of “television sociology” as a way of capturing future trends.",

It also examines the impact of media diversity on the public’s use patterns and its trust in the media, and evaluates the current state of freedom of the press in Korea. Contrary to scholarly research, which holds that freedom of the press has increased significantly over the last decade, this study found that the Korean press still faces a variety of restraints despite improvements in a few areas.",

    "abstract": "Ian Buruma makes sense of the most fateful span of Japan’s history, the period that saw as dramatic a transformation as any country has ever known. In the course of little more than a hundred years from the day Commodore Matthew Perry arrived in his black ships, this insular, preindustrial realm mutated into an expansive military dictatorship that essentially supplanted the British, French, Dutch, and American empires in Asia before plunging to utter ruin, eventually emerging under American tutelage as a pseudo-Western-style democracy and economic dynamo. Japan has always been both particularly open to the importation of good ideas and particularly prickly about keeping their influence quarantined, a bipolar disorder that would have dramatic consequences and that continues to this day. If one book is to be read in order to understand why the Japanese seem so impossibly strange to many Americans, Inventing Japan is surely it.",

    "abstract": "Through the framework provided by what Billig terms ’banal nationalism’, this article analyzes the performance of national identity in the Japanese media. The specific target for analysis is an episode of nodame cantabile, first broadcast on the Fuji Television Network in 2006. After a review of literature on Japanese nationalism, a number of bordering processes are identified, in particular: the presentation of a Japan-the West dichotomy, the re-presentation of social relationships and semiotic markers of Japaneseness, narrative devices that promote confidence in the Japanese mode of social organization, and the role of ’trickster’ played by a ’foreign’ conductor. The significance of these processes becomes clear when placed within the context of what, in the literature, has been termed the emergence of a diverse and multicultural ’New Japan’. Although the observations contained in this article do not refute this thesis, they do add a cautionary note. As is shown, the representation of Otherness found in this episode, and the way in which ’Japaneseness’ is placed in relationships with the Other, highlights difference and instrumentalizes foreigners in a way that reinforces ideas of national and cultural boundedness. For a ’New Japan’ to emerge, it is argued, alternative forms of representation are needed; however, the possibility of this or any kind of neutral representation is called into question. The article concludes by considering avenues for further research as well as the limits and potential of this type of interpretive research.",

    "abstract": "This study examines newspaper competition on a national level using the umbrella model and the county as the geographic market. Although daily newspaper markets showed higher concentration and lower competition than other U.S. industries, these markets were less concentrated and had a greater potential for competition in 1983 and 1988 than suggested by previous studies using cities as the geographic market, The levels of competition and concentration remained steady between 1983 and 1988. \\[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR\\]",

The market of today is more fluid with different and separate advertising and circulation behaviors. The concentric-circle, or ring, model proposed here preserves Rosse’s three daily-newspaper layers but alters the relation among them, better illustrates both the variety and fluidity of newspaper market roles in this country, and recognizes national and regional competition. \\[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR\\]",

    "abstract": "The traditional approach to studying media markets based on structure-conduct-performance relations has become more complex as the analysis of firms’ strategic behavior has emphasized the heterogeneity of possible market outcomes. It is argued that although greater analysis of firm strategic behavior is required, an investigation of market structure and ownership patterns remains critical for the elucidation of the nature and extent of market power. The recent history of television markets in Germany and the United Kingdom provides an example of the significance of trends in concentration and ownership for the development of competition. In addition, a full account of firms’ power may require consideration of alternative perspectives on the competitive process, but again market structure remains important. \\[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR\\]",

    "abstract": "This study explores the role of intra- and interindustry competition in the evolution of satellite broadcasting with case studies on the United States, Japan, England, and France. The case studies revealed that different patterns of inter- and intraindustry competition play a critical role in the business strategies of satellite broadcasters and their expansion in terms of subscription and market share. The findings of this research suggest that a policy framework that guarantees an adequate level of competition among content delivery technologies is required. \\[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR\\]",

    "abstract": "Global, regional, and national-level forces are shaping East Asian television broadcasting industries. National factors still have the greatest impact, but global and regional forces are becoming more important. Global media firms are expanding in the East Asian region by supplying programming to national broadcasters and, where host governments permit, by making equity investments in Asian media companies. They are also forming strategic alliances with other media transnational corporations as well as with regional and national firms. Asian broadcasters are also expanding their operations within the region, and the ethnic Chinese community in Southeast Asia is particularly important in this process. In addition, broadcasting firms with close linkages to ethnic Chinese business networks are expanding their regional operations. Because of government’s role in regulating content and entry, the bargaining relationships between states and foreign capital are central to the industry’s expansion.",

    "abstract": "A three-way experimental design examined the relative power of visual, audio, and audiovisual television messages on people’s learning of and feelings about political issues. Evidence from these experiments showed that audio alone is just as effective as a combined audio and visual presentation for conveying information, including the critical interpretation of a news story. Comparing results across stories demonstrated that encoding information in a narrative form enhanced learning from the visual track alone. In stark contrast with much of the accumulated findings on the affective impact of visuals, the results here show little difference between the affective responses to audio and video channels. Rather, subjects were most emotionally aroused by a combination of audio and visual channels, which is the essential character of television.",

Given that the eyes are more difficult to control than the mouth when people express emotions, we predicted that individuals in cultures where emotional subduction is the norm (such as Japan) would focus more strongly on the eyes than the mouth when interpreting others’ emotions. By contrast, we predicted that people in cultures where overt emotional expression is the norm (such as the US) would tend to interpret emotions based on the position of the mouth, because it is the most expressive part of the face. This hypothesis was confirmed in two studies, one using illustrated faces, and one using edited facial expressions from real people, in which emotional expressions in the eyes and mouth were independently manipulated. Implications for our understanding of cross-cultural psychology, as well of the psychology of emotional interpretation, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This article reviews recent developments in the restructuring of the satellite television industry in Japan, focusing on the degree to which new entrants and existing players have participated in its infrastructure. It shows that the Japanese government’s position toward satellite television has changed from ’protecting and promoting NHK’s interests’ as noted in the case of Broadcasting Satellite analog service to ’balancing the development of all satellite services.’ It argues that the commercial terrestrial broadcasters’ less enthusiastic attitude toward satellite television and the lack of clarity (in platform operations) in regulation have largely contributed to the stagnation of satellite television in Japan.",

    "abstract": "Videotapes of in-home television viewing of 50 individuals in five age groups (2-, 5-, 8-, and 12-year-olds, and adults), recorded over a 10-day period, revealed that 46% of time with television was spent in some activity instead of or in addition to looking at the TV. Social interaction was the most common nonviewing activity for all viewers, followed by playing and eating for children and reading for adults. Women were more likely than all other groups to do chores. Nonviewing behaviors occurred most often during programming that attracted less visual attention, particularly ads. Except for 2-year-olds, children’s attention dropped during ads to a greater extent than did that of adults. The findings have implications for theories of television use and impact including uses and gratifications, displacement, and formal feature theory.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT2014For more than 30 years, decision-making research has documented that people often violate various principles of rationality, some of which are so fundamental that theorists of rationality rarely bother to state them. We take these characteristics of decision making as a given but argue that it is problematic to conclude that they typically represent departures from rationality. The very psychological processes that lead to ’irrational’ decisions (e.g., framing, mental accounting) continue to exert their influence when one experiences the results of the decisions. That is, psychological processes that affect decisions may be said also to ’leak’ into one’s experience. The implication is that formal principles of rationality do not provide a good enough normative standard against which to assess decision making. Instead, what is needed is a substantive theory of rationality2014one that takes subjective experience seriously, considers both direct and indirect consequences of particular decisions, considers how particular decisions fit into life as a whole, and considers the effects of decisions on others. Formal principles may play a role as approximations of the substantive theory that can be used by theorists and decision makers in cases in which the formal principles can capture most of the relevant considerations and leakage into experience is negligible.",

    "abstract": "New information and communication technologies (ICTs) have allowed for changes in media content and in practices of media reception. How these changes have impacted on practices of citizenship, is the key question for this article. It starts by showing how notions of citizenship are closely related to public opinion formation, which, in turn is felt to be nurtured by journalism. The demise in newspaper readership is in that regard a worrying phenomenon. By first looking more closely at how the news itself has changed (the inclusion of vox pop segments; the wide use of polls) and by then turning to how practices of representing ordinary people point to the possibility of more inclusive notions of citizenship, the article proposes cultural’ citizenship as a sensitizing concept. As ICTs are most visibly embodied by the Internet, a number of examples are discussed from this perspective. The article concludes that ICTs do not necessarily produce new citizens but that they do provide for new and important citizenship practices. 10.1177/0267323106066634",

    "abstract": "Over 99% of modern animals are members of the evolutionary lineage Bilateria. The evolutionary success of Bilateria is credited partly to the origin of bilateral symmetry. Although animals of the phylum Cnidaria are not within the Bilateria, some representatives, such as the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, exhibit bilateral symmetry. We show that Nematostella uses homologous genes to achieve bilateral symmetry: Multiple Hox genes are expressed in a staggered fashion along its primary body axis, and the transforming growth factor-beta gene decapentaplegic (dpp) is expressed in an asymmetric fashion about its secondary body axis. These data suggest that bilateral symmetry arose before the evolutionary split of Cnidaria and Bilateria.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The rise of the has breathed new life into the practice of international history over the past few decades. Cultural approaches have both broadened and deepened interpretations of the history of international relations. This article focuses on the use of culture as an explanatory methodology in the study of international history. It outlines the two central criticisms often made of this approach. The first is that it suffers from a lack of analytical rigour in both defining what culture is and understanding how it shapes individual and collective policy decisions. The second is that it too often leads to a tendency to exaggerate the importance of the cultural predispositions of individual or collective actors at the expense of the wider structures within which policymaking takes place. The article provides a brief outline of the social theory of Pierre Bourdieu s conceptual framework can provide the basis for a more systematic approach to understanding the cultural roots of policymaking and that international historians would benefit from engagement with his approach.",

    "abstract": "This paper seeks to make a contribution to debates on ’class analysis’, as well as exploring the role of the family in class reproduction. A broad distinction is drawn between primarily ’economic’ and primarily ’culturalist’ accounts of class reproduction. It is argued that despite their differences, these accounts also share many similarities. In particular, both approaches identify the role of the family as central to the reproduction of class. However, economic and cultural accounts cannot be integrated into a single ’theory’, one reason being that the mechanisms whereby economic and cultural capital are transmitted are different. Nevertheless, economic and cultural approaches may be (and should be) used in combination with each other in order to develop a full account of the reproduction of class inequalities. In developing these arguments, a critique is offered of current theories of ’individualisation’ in relation to class and the family. The argument is illustrated by two ’worked examples’; teenage motherhood, and the patterning of mothers’ employment.",

    "abstract": "There is a continuing debate regarding the extent to which organizations are culture-free or culture bound. A recent article suggests that while cultural factors are important in the growth of organizations, they are less important in terms of structural characteristics. This same article also suggests that Japanese and Chinese organizations share the same basic Confucian culture. We argue here that the Chinese and Japanese cultural traditions have major differences and that these play out in terms of important differences in organizational structure and operations.",

This study suggests that more attention should be paid to the link between these individual-level characteristics of news workers and the content that they produce. The study is a secondary analysis of short narratives from 327 reporters who worked with a high degree of newsroom autonomy. They were asked to give a recent example of their “best work”. The topics of the stories that they cited varied systematically according to some of the reporters’ social characteristics. This finding suggests that certain individual-level factors may have a stronger link to the production of news than is generally believed. KEYWORDS",

    "abstract": "The Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913) has exerted a profound influence not only on twentieth century linguistics but on a whole range of disciplines within the humanities and social sciences. His central thesis was that the primary object in studying a language is the state of that language at a particular time–a so-called synchronic study. He went on to claim that a language state is a socially constituted system of signs that are quite arbitrary and that can only be defined in terms of their relationship within the system. This new perspective has changed the way people think about linguistics and has led to important attempts to apply structuralist ideas in anthropology, literary criticism, and philosophy. Professor Holdcroft’s book expounds and elaborates Saussure’s central ideas. It also offers a critical assessment of them, arguing that many of Saussure’s claims are either questionable or have been misunderstood. The book will be read with profit by nonspecialists and could be used as a textbook by students of linguistics, philosophy of language, literary criticism and anthropology.",

    "abstract": "The process of film making can be thought of as beginning with a person’s feeling or concern about something. To communicate this feeling to others, the film maker (sender) must develop an organic unit which will provide a vehicle that can embody the feeling/Story-Organism. The film maker selects and orders a series of signs, images, or events which translate the Story-Organism into a message. The film viewer (receiver) then reverses this process. In order to understand this process, a science of sign language (semiotic) must be developed with reference to films. A film may be thought as a series of videmes; a videme being defined as a generalized shot or take. The videme may then be examined from the standpoint of the five parameters of the structural elements of film language–Image in Motion over Time in Space with Sequence. To further develop the semiotic of film making various concepts and definitions of developmental linguistics ma y be useful. However, a methodology of research must be developed to explore them as they may apply to films. What is needed are specific hypotheses which can be tested, either by an analysis of film making or film viewing, or by controlled experiment. At the conclusion of the paper several ideas for research problems are set forth and a list of reference notes is given. (JY)",

    "annote": "This article presents a brief review of several approaches of ’grammar’, as the basis for a discussion of culturally produced regularities in the uses of colour; that is, the possibility of extending the use of ’grammar’ to colour as a communicational resource. Colour is discussed as a semiotic resource - a mode, which, like other modes, is multifunctional in its uses in the culturally located making of signs. The authors make some use of the Jakobson/Halle theory of ’distinctive features’, highlighting as signifier-resources those of differentiation, saturation, purity, modulation, value and hue. These are treated as features of a grammar of colour rather than as features of colour itself. The article demonstrates its theoretical points through the analysis of several examples and links notions of ’colour schemes’ and ’colour harmony’ into the social and cultural concept of grammar in the more traditional sense.Key Words: Colour \\* discourse \\* grammar \\* multimodality \\* semiotics",

    "abstract": "A long-range program of audiovisual research should comprise two distinguishable if sometimes overlapping types of activity: First, the conduct of experiments to test the comparative value of alternative forms of training-film presentation, some of which, at least, can be applied relatively immediately to improve the effectiveness and/or economy of current training. Second, development of theory and principles about basic factors underlying the phychological functioning of audiovisual materials as aids to learning and perception, which, while often not immediately applicable to practical problems, are essential for continued, long-range progress.This report, prepared by Professor James J. Gibson of Cornell, falls into the latter category. It is a first attempt to develop a systematic theory of pictorial perception, and, accordingly, is addressed primarily to those concerned with theory and research rather than those whose preoccupation is with immediate practical training problems. The study was undertaken on the grounds that a satisfactory theory comprehending the basic psychological factors governing the perception of pictorial material is a prerequisite to effective long-range progress in research directed toward better understanding and prediction of the effects of audiovisual training materials. As in all initial attempts at theory development, the present formulation is tentative in nature, and it is to be expected that both minor alterations and major changes in the formulation offered here will be necessary as implications of the theory are assessed critically and tested experimentally. The present report represents a second revision of an original paper, prepared under this contract, which has been reviewed critically by several leading psychologists in the field of visual perception. Despite the manifestly provisional and incomplete nature of the theoretical ideas here presented, they are believed to represent an important contribution both to psychological theory and to the ultimate development of a science of audio-visual instruction. Their use-fulness in both these directions will be directly proportional to the extent to which students and experimenters in these fields are able to verity or refute the theoretical propositions by subjecting them to experimental test.

    "abstract": "This article attempts to stabilize the concept of communicative meaning, responding to theorists who maintain that meaning has lost its moorings, that historical and linguistic forces disturb the idea of meaning so thoroughly it is impossible to achieve. In the first section, I argue that the assumption of semantic realism is necessary to any intellectual or disciplinary concept of communication. This section also distinguishes between meaning and significance: Meaning is a purposeful and constrained sharable message, and significance is the relationship of the message to other realms of importance. The second section outlines a coherentist epistemology for meaning by addressing issues in intelligibility, order, and verification. The final section contrasts a message perspective with a code perspective and explains how a theory of communication, not language, can use various considerations pragmatically (e.g., referential rules, intentionality, context) to bound meaning and keep it from slipping into incessant semiosis.",

For this purpose, it investigates a case of young Japanese in New York City and London, by using multi-sited ethnography. The major finding is that contrary to the general discussion of transnationalism, transnational media, e.g. television, newspaper, or the Internet, lead informants to renegotiate their sense of Japaneseness. The main reason seems to be that these informants have internalised the notion of the ’homogenous’ Japanese nation, and their sense of Japaneseness is intensified while living in a multiethnic society.from Cinii",

Examining and developing the work of ’cognitive film semiotics’, a neglected branch of film theory that combines the insights of cognitive science with those of linguistics and semiotics, he investigates Michel Colin’s cognitive semantic theory of film, Francesco Casetti and Christian Metz’s theories of film enunciation, Roger Odin’s cognitive-pragmatic film theory, and Michel Colin and Dominique Chateau’s cognitive studies of film syntax, which are viewed within the framework of Noam Chomsky’s transformational generative grammar.

In addition, journalists & industrial leaders tend to be educated at the same exclusive universities & belong to professional clubs in which common values are shared. The concentration of ownership of Japanese mass media is described, & the integration of the mass media with other power centers of Japanese society is discussed. Adapted from the source document.",

    "abstract": "The author reviews two current conflicting theories of what a picture is: (1) that it consists of a sheaf of light rays coming to a station point or perceiver, each corresponding to a spot of color on the picture surface and hence that the picture can stand for a real object or scene insofar as the rays from the picture are the same as the rays from the real object; (2) that it consists of a set of symbols, more or less like words, and the perceiver must learn to ’read’ it. According to the first theory, a child can perceive an object in a picture as soon as it can perceive a real object; according to the second one, the child must learn to ’read’ the picture much as it learns to read written speech. He points out the fallacies of both theories, shows that they cannot be combined and suggests a new theory based on the radical assumption that light can convey information about the world and, hence, that the phenomenal world does not have to be constructed by the mind (or the brain) out of meaningless data. This theory makes it possible to distinguish between the pictorially mediated perception of the features of a world and the direct perception of the features of the surroundings and yet to understand that there is common information for the features they have in common. His theory accounts for the difference between verbal and visual thinking. Visual thinking is freer and less stereotyped than verbal thinking; there is no vocabulary of picturing as there is of saying. As every artist knows, there are thoughts that can be visualized without being verbalized.",

A main suggestion of our analysis is that in Far East Asia the economic impact of new video media development on domestic production industries and on public television systems will be less than has been experienced in Western Europe.",

Their statistics are important not only in image compression but also for the study of sensory processing in biology, which can be viewed as satisfying certain ‘design criteria’. This review summarizes previous work on image statistics and presents our own data. Perhaps the most notable property of natural images is an invariance to scale. We present data to support this claim as well as evidence for a hierarchical invariance in natural scenes. These symmetries provide a powerful description of natural images as they greatly restrict the class of allowed distributions.",

    "abstract": "The sensory pathways of animals are well adapted to processing a special class of signals, namely stimuli from the animal’s environment. An important fact about natural stimuli is that they are typically very redundant and hence the sampled representation of these signals formed by the array of sensory cells is inefficient. One could argue for some animals and pathways, as the author does in this review, that efficiency of information representation in the nervous system has several evolutionary advantages. Consequently, one might expect that much of the processing in the early levels of these sensory pathways could be dedicated towards recording incoming signals into a more efficient form. The author explores the principle of efficiency of information representation as a design principle for sensory processing. He gives a preliminary discussion on how this principle could be applied in general to predict neural processing and then discuss concretely some neural systems where it recently has been shown to be successful. In particular, he examines the fly’s LMC coding strategy and the mammalian retinal coding in the spatial, temporal and chromatic domains.",

Flusser showed how the transformation of textual into visual culture and of industrial into post-industrial society went hand in hand, and how photography allows us to read and interpret these changes with particular clarity.",

To elucidate a cameraman’s zooming techniques, we recently examined our measurement methods and conducted a basic experiment while shooting still subjects. The results showed that our measurement methods were effective in faithfully gauging zooming characteristics. Furthermore, analyses of zooming actions revealed that, in the case of repeated shooting of the same scene. the velocity of the operating rod always followed almost the same shaped zooming velocity curve, and that the rates of size change of the subject for normalized zooming times were 0.62-0.91 (second half) in the zooming-in operation and 0.17-0.44 (first half) in the zooming-out operation.",

    "abstract": "Through some content analysis research, it has been confirmed that there are some tendencies, which can be called ’tabloidization’, in Japanese TV news programs. News programs typically include some ’soft news’, and are often dramatized in many ways. The purpose of this study is to examine, through survey research, (1) how people evaluate the tabloid aspects of TV news programs and (2) what variables affect their evaluation. The survey was conducted in Suginami-ku, Tokyo, from November to December, 1998. 270 randomly selected respondents answered the questionnaire. The major findings were: (1) More than a half of the respondents did not regard the tabloid TV news programs as problematic they accepted them. Of course, there were some people who were critical of the tabloid TV news programs, but there were also some people who vigorously welcomed the tendencies of ’tabloidization’. (2) To determine the factors that affect the evaluation of tabloid TV news programs, we administered multiple regression analysis. We found out that talkativeness, low contact with general TV programs, and habitual TV news viewing tended to cause the evaluation of the tabloid aspects of TV news programs to be positive. We also made it clear that fussiness, concern about ’hard news’, and low contact with TV news programs tended toword a negative evaluation.MIDOOKA Kiyoshi KAWABATA Miki SAITO Shinichi HAGIWARA Shigeru E GWANGHO YOKOYAMA Shigeru FUKUDA Mitsuru",

    "abstract": "This content analysis examines the use of visual elements such as photographs and graphic elements in public journalism and traditional newspapers during the general election of 2000. Public journalism newspapers used more graphic elements to convey issues and analysis, common ground and solutions, and to present information that citizens can use to contact the media than did traditional journalism, but it did not translate mobilizing information or views of citizens into graphic form more frequently than nonpublic journalism stories, nor did it use more photographs of citizens than candidates, officials, and experts. This paper links the theory behind public journalism, Yankelovich’s theory of public opinion, with Paivio’s dual-coding theory of how visual and verbal information can be pooled together, to suggest that a better theoretical model is achieved when the theory of public opinion includes the role of visual information in helping citizens come to better public judgment.",

    "abstract": "The apparently arcane question of whether an image can move reveals key difficulties concerning the tasks facing visual culture. Among them are the lack of attention to graphic and animated images, to cartography, spreadsheets and databases and other workplace media, and to the relations between image and sound, and image and text. The step from still image to moving image concerns especially the temporal dimension of human communication, a focus too often missing from poststructural analyses. This article argues for the uses of visual cultural analysis in the emergence of new visual practices.",

    "abstract": "In three experiments with difficult stimuli, it was found that the addition of a representative picture to a news item improves recall of that item. Second, as predicted by dual-coding theory (DCT), concrete news items were recalled better than abstract news items (Experiments 2 and 3). Furthermore, concrete news items benefited more from the addition of a news picture than did abstract news it ems (Experiment 3). In Experiment 4, it was found that news concreteness was strongly correlated with various picture attributes, including visual-verbal overlap, which might in part explain the differential gain in recall from the addition of pictures to concrete and abstract news. The results are explained using Paivio’s DCT.",

    "abstract": "This article has the following two overarching aims. First, it traces the development of multimodal discourse analysis and sets out its main descriptive and analytical parameters; in doing so, the article highlights the specific advantages which the multimodal approach has to offer and exemplifies its application. The article also argues that the hierarchical arrangement of different semiotics (in the way common sense construes this) should not be lost from sight. Second, and related to this last point, the article will advance a complementary perspective to that of multimodality: resemiotization. Resemiotization is meant to provide the analytical means for (1) tracing how semiotics are translated from one into the other as social processes unfold, as well as for (2) asking why these semiotics (rather than others) are mobilized to do certain things at certain times. The article draws on a variety of empirical data to exemplify these two perspectives on visual communication and analysis.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the use of archive footage in television news bulletins. Due to economic pressures and technological changes in the newsroom, there has been a general increase in the use of such secondary sources in news: press releases, public relations material, photographs from image banks and archive news footage. Looking at the contents of one film archive and several news items that use such material, we consider the implications of such footage for the nature of news as bearing witness. We also ask how viewers may interpret this footage. Do they see it as actuality or as indicative? Existing models of visual communication suggest two possibilities: that viewers will understand the footage in terms of the way it is anchored by language (Barthes) or that visual communication, like language, is made up of signs that form a grammar (Kress and Van Leeuwen), allowing viewers to ‘read’ the nature of what is communicated, such as whether it claims to be a true representation. We reject both views. Images can communicate without language, but there are important differences between images which form simple signs systems, and language which forms complex sign systems. Signs in simple semiotic systems are closer to the phenomenal world (Halliday, 1985) and closer therefore to the real world of our experiences. They powerfully index discourses within which the linguistic accompaniment can be contained. Thus, viewers are able to see archive footage as a sufficient likeness of the world through its ability to index the phenomenal world, and through the compelling nature of established news frames.",

    "abstract": "This article seeks to co-articulate a sociological and a linguistic-discourse analytical concept of style. In both fields there has been some renewed interest in the notion of lifestyle as commentators have noted that, with the decline of traditional types of social groupings such as class and age, lifestyle has become the dominant source of social identity. Both therefore centre on style as the expression of identity and values. The authors use this approach to understand the language of a global women’s magazine, Cosmopolitan. Cosmopolitan style is a hybrid of different styles, chosen for the connotations they bring, for the way they help express the magazine’s identity and values. Although local versions adopt it in their own specific ways, overall it is a global style. The local languages may differ, but the identities and values conveyed by the style do not.",

The units of images and text between which the relations obtain are identified and the realizations of the logico‚semantic and status relations are specified, both for the human analyst and a machine.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the extent to which career stratification of male college graduates is determined by their university affiliation. It argues that the popular rankings of universities may reflect specific employment practices that systematically privilege the graduates of certain universities over those of others. Such practices include the restrictive recruitment of new graduates and stratified career lines for the college-educated, white-collar workers within the employing organizations. This study divides colleges into two groups, based on the chances for initial placement in the higher managerial career track. Using data from a 1975 national survey of Japanese men, it investigates the variations in income attainment, positional achievement, and relevant attitudinal characteristics of the two groups of college graduates. The results tend to support the stratification thesis, although the differences between the two groups are less dramatic than popular perceptions would lead us to believe.",

    "abstract": "This article challenges the prevailing view that China is displacing Japan as Asia‚Äôs leader and the pre-eminent power in Asia. On the contrary, it argues that in understanding the future of Northeast Asia and the broader Asia‚ÄìPacific, it would be a mistake to look only to a rising China and to relegate Japan to a diminishing position. China‚Äôs rise does not automatically herald Japan‚Äôs decline. Japan is an emerging, not a retreating power. The rise of China is both obscuring and accelerating the transformation in Japan‚Äôs regional and global position. Japan is increasing its economic power, technological capabilities, military reach, soft power and diplomatic influence. Furthermore, the rise of China makes Japan strategically more important to the United States and to other countries in the Asia Pacific. Japan will become the main regional counterweight to China and an indispensable partner in America‚Äôs strategy of balancing China.",

    "abstract": "Free verbal recall is generally higher for items presented as pictures than for items presented as words. Possible interpretations of this effect include differential verbal elaboration, superiority of nonverbal imagery as a memory code, and dual encoding favoring pictures. A series of experiments investigated the relative contributions of imaginal and verbal memory codes using incidental recall tasks in which the orienting task was designed to control the way items are encoded during input. Three experiments required subjects to encode words and pictures verbally, by writing or pronouncing the words or picture labels; or imaginally, by drawing or imaging the picture or object suggested by the word. Two further experiments involved a probability learning task which required no encoding reaction to pictures or words, but an analogue of imaginal and verbal coding was provided in one experiment using picture-picture, picture-word (or word-picture) and word-word repetitions. Recall tests following these manipulations consistently yielded much higher recall for pictures than for words under all conditions except when subjects imaged to words. Strong support was also found for the hypothesis that image and verbal memory codes are independent and additive in their effect on recall. In addition, the contribution of imagery appeared to be substantially higher than that of the verbal code. Thus the usual superiority of pictures in free recall is best explained by dual encoding, or a combination of image superiority and dual coding, both of which are ordinarily favored when items are presented as pictures.",

    "abstract": "This article is a reading of Stuart Hall’s encoding/decoding model through his later, more mature work on articulation theory. It analyzes the underlying assumptions of the model, accounts for the criticisms made against it, and points out ways in which the theory of articulation is an advance over the earlier model. While the notion of articulation is emergent in the encoding/decoding model, it is not adequately theorized. One of the consequences is the problematic equivalence between the preferred meaning of the text and dominant ideology. Limitations such as these can be overcome through the present reading. By situating the model within the movements of Hall’s intellectual history, the article furthers the task of recasting the model for the analysis of encoding and decoding practices.",

Described are circumstances relating to legal regulation, ownership, the economy, printing facilities, newsprint production, distribution, and information flow. After its `\"`golden age” of the late 1980s, the press in Russia has entered a time of serious economic problems, a sharp fall in circulation, and growing dependence on subsidies from the government. With the disintegration of the `\"`central press,” local publications seem to be gaining more importance in the information market.",

Basically, most studies and the tables they employ are cut to the same standard pattern: the content of one or more news medium or channel is classified into a number of categories. The simplest category system contains two categories, domestic and foreign news, but as a rule there are some eight or ten categories, usually regions of the world. Sometimes, the categories are simply the nation states of the world.",

    "abstract": "Extending the study of picture postcards beyond an analysis of their content demonstrates that changes in the material circumstances of the production of postcards, and the conceptual shifts that they catalyzed, fundamentally altered the visual field of late nineteenth-century Japan. Once the postal system began in Japan in 1870, government-issued prepaid postcards, and picture postcards collected and sent from other countries, did introduce the medium to a small degree. However, private production of picture postcards only started in 1900, when postcards to which stamps could be affixed were first allowed. Stores and periodicals first produced them as promotional gifts, opening an arena for print technology experiments. During this period, government-issued commemorative postcards officially encouraged soldier-civilian correspondence, sparking wartime collecting booms. Early postcards of ‘beauties’, bound by taboos against depicting ordinary women, featured only geisha; later ones depicted ordinary women, subsequently creating a constellation of national stars, setting the stage for later postcard-format bromide paper prints of movie stars’ photographic portraits. ‘Current-events postcards’, rather than prioritizing accuracy, served as commemorative memorials. However, it was the rise of photojournalism that rendered the genre obsolete. Railway travel, besides reconfiguring and expanding the landscape of tourist destinations, also shaped practices of communication, aided by the innovation of the fountain pen. Increased speed and mobility changed travellers’ ways of seeing in a manner that, like postcards, altered visuality and transformed notions of time and space. Ultimately, picture postcards simultaneously offered intimacy with and distance from the object of the scopophilic gaze of an expanding audience.",

    "abstract": "This article examines how speech representation in Japanese journalistic discourse reflects and reproduces the social structure in Japan and the identity of the Imperial Family. Japanese newspapers tend strongly to quote the Imperial Family verbatim, which supports the thesis ‚Äòthe higher the status of the speaker, the more direct the presentation‚Äô(Glasgow University Media Group, 1980; Davis, 1985). On the other hand, Japanese newspapers also tend to quote those who address the Imperial Family verbatim, which suggests that not only the more elite the speaker, but also the more elite the addressee, the more verbatim the presentation. I argue that this practice mirrors the Japanese media‚Äôs ideology that the Imperial Family belongs to a noble class. However, there has been a sign of change in the quoting practice since the Crown Prince got married in June 1993. This change may contribute to constructing new power relations and identities in Japanese society.",

    "abstract": "Television journalism and modern design share ideals of rationality, objectivity and utility. Both institutions embrace technology in pursuit of speed and machine vision. Both aspire to editorial and technical transparence. This essay examines the development of US television news design in relation to the modernist ethos, focusing on choices to reveal, conceal and symbolize the production apparatus. I argue that the visual vocabulary of television news was established early and remains durable, constituting an International Style.’ Since this style emerged largely outside design discourse, this article looks to accounts of decision makers, analysing intentions and the resulting forms, especially as they relate to modernist ideals.",

Virtually all of Japan’s general interest newspapers are sold throught hoem delivery by exclusive distributors, whose door-to-door salesmanship often makes it less trouble for consumers to subscribe to a daily newspaper than to continue to fend off salesmen.
